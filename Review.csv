0,This huge hotel is iconic and hence draws many travellers to Singapore. We found it to be overpriced and overcrowded. The iconic swimming pool on the roof is a nice experience but security is overbearing and the staff unhelpful. There are better places to stay in Singapore.,50,1
1,"Stayed 2 nights in tower 3 level 6 - disappointing in may ways room had a strange smell and as I had a family 2 adults and 2 kids the room has 2 large ish single beds, so it was an uncomfortable night night sleeping with my boys as it wasn’t even a double bed, you get a better sized bed at Novotel for God’s sake, tv didn’t work properly, shower head sprayed everywhere....and a view of the road, make sure you get a room above at least level 10 otherwise save your cash. Then we moved to tower 1 level 27 better room but same beds, ok then....This is my third time staying here and the hotel has gone backwards in the years I have come here, service is still great but generally the place is looking tired as per photo attached, just drab. The pool is still amazing, wooden floor needs replacing but the worst part, I don’t remember water being so cold, I recon 20 degrees tops, why have the pool so cold ???? I understand you don’t want people loitering but my kids spent 5 minutes in and my wife wouldn’t go in at all, says a lot. They have also got rid of the tall tables near restaurant to eat or drink and the permanent lounge seats in water has been replaced with patio furniture sitting in water which is strange and gets burning hot in sun. When you are spending $400 + a night with beers starting at $14 a pop , guests deserve better, and I can officially say I defiantly won’t be back again. One positive this visit a local said go to “Sata by the bay” which is an easy walk behind gardens - 30 sata sticks beef / chicken ect for $20 amazing , it’s a bit of a food court with locals but I loved it and also next door is free water park / cafe for young kids. Stay once if never been but don’t waste cash in future ",30,1
2,"We spent a couple of days here at Marina Bay Sands in our holiday in Singapore. It was a very pleasent stay. The most thing that I like was their attention to the client. They care about any single detail and they were there before to know that you need them. The infinity pool was very nice but as we expected ...wery noisy and crowded. The skypatk it was nice also...very nice pictures from there:)The room was very clean, well maintained, comfortable and it looks pretty good.",30,1
3,"One major complaint. Engaged MBS’s valet service for Thursday & Friday. Checked out on Saturday at about 12.30pm. As the valet guy handed us our key, he said something in a very fast speed but we just took the key, said our thanks and left.  It was only when we were about to get out of the car at a food centre which is 10 mins away from MBS, that my husband made sense of what that valet guy had said – that he (my husband) needed to open the door from the OUTSIDE. This meant that the door could no longer be opened from the inside! We went out on the Friday evening before and sure as hell everything worked as normal before we passed it on to the valet for the night. So we returned back to the hotel and spoke to a few of the valet guys who were on duty. The impression they gave was all that matters to them was to clear all the cars that needed to be parked and that our issue is the least of their concern. One of them even had the cheek to ask my husband if we have our own mechanic and get it sorted ourselves! You damaged our door handle and asked us to fix the problem ourselves? He said that they were very busy. EXCUSE US, do you think we were so free on our time to come back to you?! My husband remained very polite throughout (hats off to him, I tell you) and explained that we were there to have the issue solved and not make a fuss. So since that guy said he was busy, please get the Manager. This was even frustrating because not one, but two of the valet staff were clearly hesitant to call for their Manager. When the gentleman finally arrived, all he did was ask my husband to lodge a complaint. He went on the line that whatever happens, “he makes the call”. Omg was that some kind of a threat? We received a call on Saturday night about 10+pm from a Supervisor, only for him to say they would look into the cctv and investigate. We haven’t heard anything since. MBS’s valet operations team needs to look into how to handle customers complaints/issue on the spot. There was no genuine/personal touch at all. So bare and so cold!! This is the service standard? Those valet guys were unprofessional at handling these issues, although no doubt they are efficient in clearing all the cars. As this matter is horribly attended to, this the reason why I am writing here in TA. My husband and I are hoping the VP or Director of Operations to reach out to us and have this issue addressed.Pros: Service staff at check in/out were great. Premier room is very spacious, nice pleasant view and bathtub is wow. Perhaps can add on some bath salt. Room attendant (a Chinese gentleman serving level 17) was always genuinely polite and friendly every single time we bumped into him. As we were in line for checking out, there was a staff who gave away bottled juices, which we really appreciate the nice gesture.As you can see, we have more pros than cons. But that one con – valet – is enough to really ruin our impression of MBS. I hardly complaint but this really needs one.",50,1
4,This place is expensive but omg the view is awesome from the room. The room was amazing but the best part was the view from the room. The pool was great but it was kind of disappointing with it being so shallow. This is a famous hotel in Singapore and everyone has so many great reviews over this place but I must say that for the price its king of average.,20,1
5,We were really in awe seeing the Singapore Skyline. It was my first time in Sg but i never expected it to be so clean and so good. LOL. We will definitely be back here soon and stay at MBS. Food are great plus the casino and shops are big. Too many people staying at this hotel but all thanks to the people we interacted with that made me feel like I was home.  ,30,1
6,"Was here on business for 3 days and boy, it was one spectacular property. Enough options to not make you want to leave the hotel. The infinity pool, mall, food court et al, was fabulous. Great staff and views of the marina from the balcony were the highlight of the tour.",50,1
7,We stayed here during our Singapore holiday and enjoyed the club room and the infinity pool very much. The room is spacious with great view even though the decor is a bit dated. Pool is crowed but our little girl loved it so much we stayed from early afternoon to 10pm most nights. The food options at the pool is limited and buffet breakfast at level 55 is very average. ,50,1
8,Truly outstanding. This destination resort is so big and comprehensive you can arrive and never need to venture out as there is absolutely everything you need in one magnificent spot.Service is provided by wonderful caring staff who go above and beyond in every way.Food offer is extensive and the best of everything.Can't wait to return.,40,1
9,"A once in a lifetime experience this hotel. 57 stories high, 3 towers, pool on the top with a terace. A must see and a must do. Especially at night the scenery is superb. Rooms are great. Everything is there. Attached to exhibition center. Many restaurants in and around the hotel. Bring your creditcard. It is not cheap, but you only live once. Put it on your bucket list. ",50,1
10,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel is divided into 3 towers, which offers views of the city or Gardens by the Bay (GBTB). The hotel is linked to The Shoppes and Convention Halls, and GBTB is just a link bridge away. Nearest MRT station (aka subway) is Bayfront.",40,1
11,"By unpersonal approach I mean that hotel is so huge and occupied that you r hving feeling that you r checking in to a good deal hotel in the middleOf shopping centre... It is majestic but for a 400 €/night without breqkfast you should get more. Even though, only hotel guests are allowed to a legendary roof top infinity pool, its totaly crowded, in the morning or evening or in rain...always! As well as to get a (good) table in rooftop restaurant is difficult...Food and drinks in hotel are very expensive.The music bar is cool with a great ambience but again totaly crowded...no chance to get even a stand by table...Rooms are amazing, i have no complaint abt that...luxury, comfy..and the view is spectacular...Would not visit it again...not worth the money...",50,1
12,"Have not been to Singapore in over 7 years so wanted to experience the newer and very famous Marina Bay Sands. Maybe due to the casino and convention areas I really felt like I was in Las Vegas. Mix of convention attendees, families, couples and tours. Besides the early morning everything and everywhere is bustling and crowded. If you want kind of a overwhelming resort/casino experience this is the place to be. Our suite was huge and kept very clean. Staff at whatever breakfast venue we choose were amazing. The main attraction is the infinity pool which for me was a major disappointment. Did not utilize at all. Always crowded with most taking selfies in and out of the water. Water in the pool itself was cloudy. Just walking around was difficult due to the amount of people taking pics. People in the elevators wearing their hotel bathrobes going to and from the pool. Always at least 6 people in bathrobes on each of my elevator rides, seemed a bit odd. Attached to a luxury mall was very convenient.Again if you want to be overwhelmed this is the place to go. Great location, walking distance to the Gardens by the Bay. Again, staff is amazing.",40,1
13,"What a hotel, stayed for 4 days this place is amazing. From the minute you walk in its 5* service.Had a garden room with amazing views, room was large with a balcony.There are 3 restaurants for breakfast 1 of them on the roof. We found ""adrift"" to be the best smaller and more personal than others with better choice of food.The pool is awesome also on the roof is a bar/night club CÉ LA VILAVO Italian bar & restaurantSpago by Wolfgang Puck.We ate at LAVO,( had a lovely steak) And also at spago its more sharing bit (ribs sliders) There is a casino and an amazing shopping centre attached to the hotel with some great bars and restaurants. Had lunch at bread street(Gordon Ramsey) Of a night there is a water and lazer show on marina Bay itself.My only complaint.... We weren't leaving hotel till 8pm, After 11am check out you can't use pool area so we were abit stuck on what to do for 9hrs... But there is a room to get a shower. ",30,1
14,"I booked for a room for my birthday celebration. Upon arriving, the checkin/check out are was so crowded, because it was common area where people transfer from malls and other nearby places. Long que for checking in ,but they gave a small cornetto ice cream and water. The front desk officer greeted me a happy birthday,but nothing special or letter on the room like other hotels do. We arrived 2pm and the standard check in time is 3pm, so they gave us a temporary access to pool and bar at 57th floor, and they will just send an email once room is available and they have done it. I can say that the room is typical like 3-4 star hotel set up. Far from my expectation. We decided to went up at infinity pool which is our main purpose of stay, but unfortunately the weather is bad and they have to close it temporarily due to thunderstorm, we stayed at celavi, bar outside the pool, while waiting. They resume opening the pool after an hour. I can say that my stay at MBS is very usual, nothing special on facilities and services in which I expect given that they price is too high for a night. Value for money . Hust for the sake of experience.",50,0
15,"Whether viewing the bay on foot or from one of the bay cruise boats it’s truly an amazing accomplishment.Massive buildings, Gardens in the air with all the Fullerton Hotel and all the sky scrappers looking inwards its an experience not to forget.",30,1
16,"Marina Bay Sands as a hotel didn’t stand out to be anything special from a hotel perspective, on par with most other 5 star hotels around the world. The best thing about it as expected was the pool experience. It’s worth staying here and the premium just for that, incredible and well worth it! It does get very busy, although we noticed that people are mainly there for a photo and leave. As well as the pool, there are also some Jacuzzi’s which are not as well known about, providing the same experience facing the Gardens By The Bay. This was impressive. Pool is open late too (11pm). ",50,1
17,"We stayed for 1 night in this amazing hotel in a club room during the week of the Grand Prix. What can I say it was fabulous right down to the cream tea,  drinks and canapes. The room was beautiful and we overlooked the amazing city and directly in front of the light show which we watched from our very own lounge seating area. The hotel staff were fabulous but the most impressive was the young lady who spoke to my husband using his surname after only 1 visit to the club room dining/lounge area (Thank you so much as this made our stay so personal. The infinity pool although busy was an experience we will never forget, it's open till 11 at night so you get to view the skyline in the evening - Amazing. Fantastic Stay and absolutely loved it. Ended our holiday with a bang. Thank you so much Singapore, you are an amazing City. ",50,1
18,"We just stayed at this hotel. We booked an upgraded room to take full advantage of the perks such as Club55 and the higher level rooms. We ended up staying in the orchard suite which offered the most amazing views and was huge for the two of us. If you’re booking this hotel thinking you are going to be getting the best room in Singapore, you’re deluded and I personally think it’s unfair to rate this hotel just on the room. I imagine there are much nicer rooms on offer in singapore but a hotel on this scale is never going to be able to offer the best rooms due to the sheer upkeep on the whole hotel, you book this place for so many more reasons other than a hotel room. In our opinion the whole hotel makes up for not having the most plush room to rest your head or the service sometimes being a tad slow. The views, the shopping facility, the service, the pool, the bars and restaurants, the water/light shows and amazing staff make the hotel fantastic. We were pleased with our room, the hotel and our experience. We wouldn’t hesitate on staying here again and would definitely recommend Marina Bay Sands. ",50,1
19,"If you want to stay at an iconic hotel in Singapore this is the only place to stay. Yes it's incredibly busy with 2500 rooms, plus additional visitors to the restaurants, roof top pool and shopping complex but despite all that the service is fast friendly and efficient so much so you never seem to que for anything, well other then check in!. We stayed in a suite which was large well equipped with fantastic views overs the gardens and sea. Yes it feels big busy and like an airport when you first step in but get past that and the MBS lives up to its 5star billing. It's pricey but defiantly worth the price, and you must try the pool!",50,1
20,"What can I say other than AMAZING HOTEL. The hotel room was fantastic with brilliant views of Gardens by the Bay. The staff are so helpful, nothing is too much for them. Even down to the towel decorations!! The beds are an absolute dream to sleep in and the facilities are just the best. The infinity pool was incredible. I can´t think of anywhere else to have celebrated my husbands 50th birthday other than here!!",50,1
21,"excellent for one night stay, you know, bucket list Overpriced and overcrowded, too many people, not enough luxury.We had “upgraded “ room with no seat for a guest, no shaving kits, and you don’t want to see what is going on behind ( very outdated) tv , seriously, clean it , at least once a year.Very strange rules for the mini bar, drank one can of coke, charged for four and pineapple juice, which I didn’t even see.Stuff is nice and efficient, view and pool amazing.Not coming back though, checked ✅",50,1
22,"Stayed here a couple of times on business and private trips to Singapore over the past years. The reason for choosing MBS is always the same: It's amazing skyline views from the room and from the rooftop lounge!If you are staying for business, the hotel is also in close proximity to all major financial and commercial hubs.The only flaw that I encountered during my trips is the relatively low level of personalised service for Asian standards. Due to the high popularity and number of guests check in and check out can feel like a mass processing.",30,1
23,"Convenient location for our family as we have a 2 year old toddler, they have an overpass that connects the hotel to gardens by the bay which is great to visit at any time of the day. We stayed 2 nights, very professional service by the hotel staff, fast check-in/check-out. Even though the lobby is busy you don't get the feeling of it being overcrowded, the staff handle it well. The rooms are really spacious, clean and a joy to stay in and infinity pool was worth the visit and not overcrowded, just beautiful views! Even though the hotel is undoubtedly very expensive, if you have the money, don't hold back! Give it a go, at least for one night! From the shopping centre that connects to the hotel, to the casino, to the convenience of the MRT below and for the proximity of the hotel to the gardens by the bay, you won't be disappointed",40,1
24,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands in November this year. This place is amazing and should be on everyone's bucket list. We were o the 48 th floor in Tower 2, the views from the room over the Singapore were spectacular. the room was luxurious and extremely comfortable as was the bed.The shower room was huge and it had a separate bath. There is an espresso machine in the room and bottled water is provided daily.The infinity swimming pool on the 55th floor provides you with the best views in all of Singapore. The only issue is that the pool is only 1.2 metres deep and is always crowded with people constantly taking selfies, still worth a look and a refreshing escape form the humidity of Singapore.We also paid extra for access to club 55 , which is on daily from 5.00 - 7.00 pm and provides complimentary food and drinks during that time.The breakfast buffet has the most diverse and comprehensive range of options that I have ever encountered, not to mention that the food itself is delicious.The hotel itself is well appointed and amazingly decorated. We ate breakfast at drift on the ground floor and could not fault it.The Staff are extremely polite and helpful.The only issue if there is one is that this place is crowded, it has 2,500 rooms available and regardless of the time (day or night) there are always people milling around or walking through the expansive lobby.Overall, this place is a must for any one travelling to Singapore, well worth it although it is a bit pricey ($2,600 AUD for 3 nights). But you do get what you pay for, could not fault it.",50,1
25,"We booked a grand club room and loved it. We had a amazing Singapore city view as well as access to club 55 which had a delicious breakfast as well as snacks throughout the day. This hotel is know for the views. We have friends that live in Singapore and without knowing where we were staying they all booked restaurants at the marina bay sands for the view. Luckily we had the same view as the restaurants from our bed. The infinity pool is definitely worth a visit and was not overly crowded even though it was great pool weather. The downstairs of the hotel has a great cocktail lounge. I cannot remember the name but the cocktails are the best I have had. If you want to shop, the attached mall has every designer you could ever imagine and a whole wing of High end designer children’s clothes. Fantastic people watching. I would do a club room because the club 55 perks are worth it. ",50,1
26,"Since this is our honeymoon trip, we are more willing to spend more on the trip, that’s why we chose this special and luxury hotel for our special occasions.As we arrived Singapore in the earlier morning, that’s great the hotel let us check in at around 11:30, we could stay in the hotel to take some rest.I sent a confirmation email to the hotel before let them know my requests, I do appreciated they arranged the room decoration and high level floor for our honeymoon.The hotel is really convenience for shopping and some attractions visit as there is a high-end shopping mall next to the hotel and there is “Garden by the bay”, “top roof swimming pool” and ArtScience Museum which are recommended. But when I went to the top roof swimming pool the security over there are impolite. That’s weird I went through the entrance but when I wanted to leave the security in the exit shout to us and said we cannot stay here simply as the swimming pool is closed? I was wonder if that’s closed why no one stop us from the entrance ??? How come the security knows I just passed by but not going to have a drink on the bar? This made me feel bad for this hotel. Apart from that everything is fine.The top roof swimming is worth to visit which is so beautiful. But honestly speaking apart from that nothing special for this hotel.",50,1
27,"Undeniably the nicest hotel in Singapore. Absolutely stunning and surprises around every corner. The grounds and views are spectacular and the service is unparalleled. Keep in mind, you pay a premium, but if you're ever in Singapore, it's at least worth the splurge for a night.",50,1
28,"mass production.You pay for pool access, a very good location, a spectecular building and stunning views!In all other aspects expect a 3-4 stars hotel experience at highly overrated prices for what is delivered.It was a nice experience, but i would not have to stax there again, would choose another Singapore hotel with higher hotel standards and spend the difference there, where you for sure get a better and more personalised hotel performance, if you are looking for this.Nothing really to complain, but as i said, it is mass production  ",50,1
29,"Stayed for 2 nights at MBS, check in was fine and friendly we were initially allocated room next to air conditioning unit that was noisy but as we arrived very late on we it up with a fragmented nights sleep. Following morning Terry swapped our room to overlook bay and gardens which was much improved. Rooms are spotless and great nights sleep was had. Breakfasts are fabulous with choices to satisfy everyone. The infinity pool and upper viewing areas are what makes MBS famous and have to be seen to be believed. ",30,1
30,Must visit the Food Court of MBS it is not your ordinary food court plus the other high end and average restaurants in the complex is fantastic.Catch a show if you see something you like when you are there. Casino is not good for non smokers.,40,0
31,"This hotel certainly wowed us. We only stayed for 1 night but it was spectacular and well worth the high price. The service is first class, everything is so clean and luxurious. Our room was on the 9th floor and we had an amazing view of Supertree Grove (pic attached). The infinity pool is worth the hype and I can honestly say I've never had a hotel experience like it before. I wish I was wealthy enough to stay here for longer.",50,1
32,"This hotel definitely has the wow factor. Our luggage was taken from us as soon as we stepped out from our taxi and transferred to our room while we checked in.We arrived at 11 am after very long flight, we were aware check in time was at 2pm but lady receptionist kindly checked us in early for no extra cost. The lobby looks like an airport to be fair, definitely lack the personal feel.Our room was on the 42th floor, we had the garden view - the view is just breath taking, the bed really comfortable and room spotless.The highlight of the stay is the pool area. It is very busy but you kind of expect that when the hotels accommodates thousands of guests! Only downside is - everything - EVERYTHING in that hotel is very expensive. Little bottle of tiger beer 20 SGD, you are not allowed to take your own drinks (not even the ones from their own mini bar) to the pool either - I didn't know that and got told off by the staff and there is only two smoking areas - one outside the hotel and one on the other side of the pool. So from 42th floor it takes you good 20 minutes to reach either of them.We didn't eat in the hotel but ordered room service on our second day - food was lovely but very pricey.All in - impressive building, ticked it off from my bucket list - would I stay again considering the price we paid? Only if I won lottery, otherwise no.",50,1
33,"Stayed here on our last night of our honeymoon. We always wanted to stay at this hotel and it did not disappoint. The room was enormous with floor to ceiling windows commanding sweeping views over the Singapore skyline. It had one of the best bathrooms ive ever been in a hotel with a very impressive walk in shower. The check in process was faster than I expected given how busy the hotel is. The pool is fascinating and one of the great experiences of Singapore. It can get crowded but it is a nice place to spend the night or the day enjoying one of the worlds best views. Just dont forget sunblock. It can be a little cool on top of the pool so dont expect optimum climate for swimming, despite being in tropical Singapore.",40,1
34,"Thye Hong in Rasapura in Marina Bay Sands is guaranteed to be serving delicious food, a little bit pricy for me bit then I can really say its yummy! you just need to wait maybe around 5 minutes if the place is not so busy and cravings solvedvery tasty!!!",50,1
35,"The views from the hotel pool are absolutely stunning, and room views are also incredible. Staff are all incredibly nice and helpful people. The only issue is towels need to be collected from pool chairs when people stop using them to avoid confusion. Otherwise, totally worth going to take some instagram worthy pictures!",50,1
36,"We were in Singapore for 4 nights as an extended stop over after 7 nights in the Maldives celebrating our 30th Wedding Anniversary. We decided to stay 2 nights at MBS because we felt ""you've just got to experience it"" but we were a little concerned about a lot of the negative reviews. So we stayed 2 nights and 2 nights at another hotel across the bay.We splurged on a club room with all the benefits (you only have 1 30th anniversary right!) and it was worth every penny. From the quick check in (the people waiting in the lobby did not look very happy with their long wait as mentioned in some other reviews), to the ""complementary"" drinks & canapes in club 55 & also breakfast there each morning away from the crowds was well worth it. Our huge room on the 49th floor was gorgeous with amazing views of the light show each night. The pool - obviously it is pretty crowded but it is mighty spectacular and well worth the effort to get that perfect pic. We didn't go there expecting to relax around the pool all day so we really weren't too disappointed in the amount of people there. We had no trouble getting a sunbed either.All in all, the size and scale was a bit overwhelming at first but we found the staff and service to be excellent, the location is brilliant and we loved every moment.",50,1
37,"Arrived a bit late due to flight complications very pleasant and friendly staff , upgraded Us to a higher room really good , room was fantastic spacious clean loads of extra ‘s the view was to die for,Bed was massive and comfortable the bathroom was out of this world ,we was on the 32 floor, the swimming pool was as it is in the picture amazing had a great stay it’s more of a complex than hotel The restaurants are nice but pricey best bet is go to the food court where it is very reasonable and big selection. The staff are great and very helpful they even ask you how should I address you well I’ve never been asked that before ...fantastic stay Singapore is brilliant . Only thing I point out that’s a down is not enough seating in reception when checking out . Well done Marina bay sands for the experience. ",50,1
38,"As part of our holiday we stayed at the marine sands hotel. Looks impressive on first look but you start to see the cracks underneath. We got offered a late check for my husbands birthday which was nice. We got to our room which was smoking, wasn’t asked our preference. It smelt we had to move this took way too long we got late for my husbands birthday dinner. Then they didn’t put my husbands cake in the room. Even though I gave them specific instructions. Overall the attention to detail is lacking and was really disappointed overall happy to be moving to a smaller boutique hotel can’t wait! ",50,1
39,"I was lucky enough to win a night at the marina bay sands in a charity raffle. As a local I drive past this impressive building every day on my way to work. And I always wondered what the pool at the top would be like. Well, in one word - overcrowded. This is far from the relaxation haven their promotional material would have you believe. We could not even find a spare seat to sit on. The pool staff try their hardest, but trying to distinguish between who is in the pool or who has just left their deck chair for the day and gone home is very difficult. Half of the deck chairs were empty with towels on. And I guess 50% of those had left the pool area entirely! Oh well. It’s very much more a ‘place to be seen’ with people uploading their photos on Facebook and Instagram. Very sad, very shallow, but that’s the world we live in.So the rooms.....again.....not as good as I expected. They are massive in size, but everything feels like 2010. Nothing modernist about it. Bathroom old. Tv old. Great views of course. Comfy king size bed. Reception overrun and takes a long time to speak to anyone. A victim of its own success?",20,1
40,"We had a wonderful stay at Marina Bay Sands. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Excellent customer service, great breakfast selection, and of course, beautiful decor. Infinity pool is incredible. You will expect a lot of people takings pictures and getting excited, but this is absolutely normal for such worldwide famous location. You might get a chance and take a picture just with you in it and no one else around. The only negative side to it, that the water was quite cold, while the temperature outside wasn’t too warm, therefore you won’t be able to enjoy staying in the pool for a while. However, there are jacuzzi pools available on the other side, facing a beautiful view too.We went to a bar on the roof top and didn’t enjoy it much. It was overcrowded, messy and dj kept playing old music and seemed that he just put on a CD without any effort. However on the other side of the floor there is a very pleasant lounge bar called  Lavo... incredibly beautiful, highly recommend to visit for a tasty dessert and a couple of drinks in a nice environment and a view.Overall, me and my partner had a beautiful experience at this hotel and would definitely recommend to choose it while visiting Singapore. ",30,1
41,"This is a brilliant but busy hotel. Very modern, clean and luxurious. The main attraction is definitely the pool and worth staying here for a night just to be able to go in it. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable - definitely recommend opting for a Garden View if you get the option as it looks over Gardens by the Bay.",50,1
42,Really enjoyed my first visit here Celavi the roof top bar at Marina Bay Sands. The service I experienced was top-notch. World class. Shout out to Mr. Mhiko and the rest of the team. You guys are amazing. Mr. Mhiko is very friendly and attentive in all my needs. You need more staff like mhiko. In fact I don't feel like i'm a newbie guest because the staffs welcomed me so warm and with a big smile in their faces. Will definitely add MBS on my itinerary everytime I visit SG.,50,1
43,Stayed for one night in this classy hotel. We booked a sky view room and it was on the 43 rd floor in the third tower. The room was amazing and not less than a suite. Comfortable bed and all the seven star amenities.The infinity pool was lovely...a bit crowded but it was definitely worth it. The food and beverages were over priced but this was expected.There is a high end shopping mall which is attached to the hotel and a casino for some fun. Hotel is easily accessible by metro and round the clock taxis are available to explore the city.Had no idea about the breakfast as we didn't opt for it.If you're in Singapore and have one day to spare then stay in this hotel is absolutely recommended to have complete Singapore experience and also because in order to use or see infinity pool one has to be a legal guest of the hotel. Visitors are only allowed till the sky observation deck(for a fee) which is couple of floor lower than the infinity pool ( 55 floor).Pictures and words will not do justice.One has to stay to experience this outstanding property.,50,1
44,"Clearly inspired by Vegas with casino and mall with “Shoppes” but misses the mark. The casino is for serious gamblers, with no bar and no atmosphere. Alcoholic drinks are available from the staff wandering around but there is nowhere to sit other than one or two restaurants. The Shoppe mall offers various high end products and a bad copy of the Venetians gondolas. The hotel has Three towers, #1 closest to the main entry, #2 then #3. The observation deck is above tower #3 and open to the general public for a fee. Hotel guests have free access but it is quite busy so not worth the trouble. Rooftop pool is really something to see, there are two pools one for adults only and one shared with kids. The pool attendants are quick to remind wayward children where their pool is and people who try to “reserve” pool chairs with a towel and wander off all day will find their towel removed after ½ hour. We stayed in the Grand King room which offers premium check in and afternoon canapés on level 55. Drinks are expensive in Singapore (2 cocktails + 2 beers = $84.00) so take advantage of the club room privileges where the beer and wine flows freely right till the last minute. The room is large, well-appointed and very comfortable. Certainly worth it if you want to part with the money but after $750.00 Singapore dollars per night I thought it was a bit rude adding another $50.00 for a city view. There really isn’t much in walking distance other than the gardens by the bay but no bars or mini marts etc. No point buying your own beer anyway because the one thing that they did bring back from Vegas perfectly is the useless monitored bar fridge. Now one thing that bugged me was the credit card deposit. $1400.00 up front for two day plus $400.00 bond = $1800.00. Then on checkout they charge another $1400.00 for the room while the $1800.00 is still on the card. It took 5 days for the initial $1800.00 to drop off the card. Would I stay there again? Probably not, but we did enjoy the place and it is really worth it at least once.",50,1
45,"Making it a point not to repeat too much of  what everyone else is on here saying about this landmark hotel.   So I’ll make it quick before I get to why my title says what it says... Yes yes... stay here for access to the amazing rooftop 57th floor infinity pool. You have to be a hotel guest to try it so no choice there.  It’s very convenient!  MRT access right below the hotel, restaurants, shopping... everything you’ll ever need and want is right here!  Awesome  Yup... like most are saying.  The rooms are airy and sizable, not mesmerizing or ultra luxurious but it’s good enough. For my main point...  I highly regard having a relaxing shower or bath while I’m on any vacation.  Especially when visiting a hot humid muggy tropical climate!  One of the highlights of my days or evenings is being able to jump into the shower to have a relaxing bath.  No... I’m not complaining about the marble laden floors and the fancy papered walls, or even the beautiful fixtures that adorn the ceiling and mirrors.  It’s that dreadful high efficiency shower head  that they’ve installed.   The amount of water that trickles out of the sardine can-like indoor water feature is almost as trivial as trying to shower in my greenhouse whilst the delicate misters are running creating a indoor foggy wonderland.  I mean... seriously???  This is a five star hotel with a ridiculously large infinity pool set on top it’s 57th floor.  There’s enormous amounts of water running out the sides of that pool like a Singaporean Niagara Falls... and I’m here trying to wash my crew cut hairdo for 10mins just to get a decent rinse off so I don’t walk out of the shower looking like a elephant just came all over my head and shoulders.  Slightly pissed off at the water pressure... I even unboxed one of those cheapo toothbrushes that the hotel so graciously provides to attempt and clean out the pin-like micro holes in the shower head to get a little more water flow to my semi damp body.   Oh... did I mention when I first turned on the shower the (mister) head was more than half clogged?  The moment I turned on the shower, water was misting in all directions!  At first I thought this was due to an error on my part.  Maybe I just don’t know how to operate this fancy contraption.   My first experience was cold and slightly wet in all the wrong places as I was bare assed and frantically trying to figure out what the hell was going wrong with this shower.   So... if the management is reading this... please install a proper shower head in the bathrooms of your fancy five star hotel.  I just came from a Hoshinoya in Tokyo and they had a awesome shower.  If you’re sooooo worried about guests wasting water then maybe install a timer or just place a placard reminding guests about how scarce clean water is and to not waste such a precious resource.   I seriously don’t think that I’m saving much water by having to take a excruciating 30min shower vs a 5-10min one utilizing a shower head with reasonable flow and pressure!!!   There goes one star for this five star establishment.  ",40,1
46,"Dear Mobotech,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. I regret to learn about the challenges you experienced with the shower water pressure in your room. I would like to take this opportunity to share that as part of our ongoing Sustainability efforts, we are consistently reviewing ways to better improve our guest experiences whilst adhering to Singapore’s water sustainability guidelines. I have sent you a private message and I hope to hear from you soon.",40,1
47,"First off, this place has 3 huge towers, multiple elevators a subway, casino, stores and restaurants.  Second, I want to send a huge shoutout to the hotel for helping me celebrate my birthday and for the complimentary cake.Don't take this place lightly because you can actually spend a day just at the hotel and have everything you need. I do not know the difference between the towers but I was located in Tower 2. The place is very clean on the outside.  Once arriving at my room, the place was completely clean and smelled fresh.  There are outlets next to the beds to include USB so no need to bring multiple chargers.  I am very happy with the outlet locations since I have CPAP machine and outlets next to the bed are very big to me. The only room complaint I have is that the bathroom light is located at the door.The infinity pool will run your phone crazy with the pictures that you will take.  The water is on the cool side but a comfortable temperature.  The view is amazing and highly recommended to visit.  There are towels, restaurants and a bar located on site so everything is at your fingertips.  If you don't enjoy yourself here, just go back home.",10,1
48,"I decided that I wanted to stay here after seeing it on my first visit to Singapore and then watching the TV program about it and that pool!The pool did not disappoint, I visited in the evening and then again in the morning and both times, despite being a weekend, it was not too crowded. The views were spectacular and the staff were great, could not beat poolside breakfast with a bellini!The room I was in was fine but quite small and plain for a 5 star and not as nice as other places I have stayed hence the reason I have given this hotel 4 out of 5. As only hotel guests can use the pool I would say it is worthwhile staying here just to do that.",50,1
49,"We stayed in the MBS Sands Suite Room and it was huge. Not to mention everything in the mini bar was free (except for the spirits and wine). The view from the room was amazing, as we faced the gardens and could see the sea as well. We would like express our gratitude and compliment our butler Mr Calvin Lam, who was very friendly, professional, and went all the way to meet our needs. We had numerous requests as we had our one-month-old infant and 20-month-old toddler with us, but he was very patient and even gave us a surprise cake, with kueh lapis and drinks as we celebrate the special occasion of our baby girl's full month. Calvin was very energetic and even when we needed something at 10pm, he was still full of smiles and went the extra mile to help us. He arranged everything for us to make sure we felt at home. We could not thank him enough for making this staycation a perfect one.",40,1
50,This place is huge. Only hotels in Las Vegas can match this place for sheer size. The viewing deck on the 56th floor is a view worth the cost of the tickets. Having a beer and checking out the surroundings below you is something people will never forget.,50,1
51,"We decided to stay here for a night due to a layover coming back home. Check-in line was long.  It lacked hospitality, possibly due to its size???  It reminded me of Las Vegas hotels.  It was noisy even late at night after 1 am.  Thank goodness I had ear plugs to sleep.  The pool was not heated so it was uncomfortable to be in during the evening.  We stayed in the pool only for a couple of pictures to say we were there.  The pool was also very crowded.  Our room wasn’t clean well.  Upon our arrival, we noted the sticky coffee stains on the floor and a Bobby pin left behind.  The housekeeper did leave a cute folded towel of an elephant on my bed.  We had a view of the Gardens by the Bay which was very pretty.  I wouldn’t return to this hotel if I was in Singapore again.  I prefer the smaller boutique hotels.  ",50,0
52,Do visit these place at celavin in marina bay sand. The top view is too good and value for money. Good place to hang out with friends. Must visit when you are in Singapore trip. Unlimited fun and outdoor view.,30,1
53,"The hotel is precisely a tickmark stay to experience the hype, just like atlantis in dubai or venetian in macau. The checkin process while not as strenuous as the atlantis was ok, however we were allotted a room in tower 2 while entire group got rooms in tower 1 making the coordination arduous. The rooms are average sized (not expected at this high fare) and very basic ... You feel you are just paying for the view (which is breathtaking for sure. The infinity pool which is a major highlight is also a major hype and is actually a set of 3 small pools. Despite such high stay rates , the hotel is surprisingly low on amenities, it does not have a child play area, the lobby does not even have a proper place to sit .. All in all , at the money that you pay, the hotel is strictly average",50,1
54,Would recommend staying to experience this hotel. The infinity pool speaks for itself. We had the even better experience of going up for a sunrise photo only to be party of a storm that hit. It was brilliant! Like being in the middle of a hurricane 57 floors up! Service was ok. Check in wasn’t very good. We was early. But happy to wait until 3pm for our room. (Took us a long time in the uk to decide which room type we wanted) they offered us alternative rooms. Which were either lower ground or a different view to check in early. But we wanted to keep the one we had booked. Ended up losing our luggage for a while which was stressful as it was sent to another room. It was all sorted in the end and given our original room type early. So don’t really understand why that wasn’t done to start with instead of trying to put us in another roomCasino is massive and very busy. But a great experienceBurger restaurant is lovely and the freak shakes are worth a try. But share one!!!Gardens are epic. Try and make it for the light showFountain show is really busy so get there early for a spot. Overall good hotel for the experience. But a little too large and busy for my liking ,30,1
55,"It's a great hotel. Great service. Great food, etc. All you could expect from a top line Asian hotel. Room is spacious and nice. The only real reason to stay here is for the spectacle. The roof pool is a bucket list thing to do and really the only thing that makes this hotel extra special. Everything else is what you would expect.  But to have a meal on the roof, lay in the pool, etc.  That is just special and everyone should do it at least once.  If you like to gamble or shop - then this hotel is for you. Otherwise - it's just all about the roof!",40,1
56,"What a place!!  It’s been on my bucket list for a hot minute. They are the most welcoming staff, let us check in early, upgrades our room for absolutely no reason ;) and give you water and mango juice upon check in. The pool is amazing, get a spot early if the weather is nice. You can walk right out of the hotel to Gardens by the Bay. We will stay here again for sure! ",50,1
57,"On a recent family visit to Singapore this was definitely on our list of places to visit. The structure is massive and so iconic for Singapore it is hard to miss, dominating the city. It is worth visiting just to see the unreal architecture and the amazing views from the viewing deck.A unusual experience going in a lift with no windows and only buttons fro floor 1 and then 56..but the views justify it.Equally it plays a key in the Light show in the Bay so it is amazing to see at night as well. A must visit in Singapore to sample the atmosphere and architecture",50,1
58,This hotel is a must when visiting Singapore! The highest in Singapore with use of inifinity pool when you stay! When you go to Singapore it was definitely one of the highlights of our stay! Service is brillant always checking if you want drinks by the pool or if you need anything for the room. Heard the minibar can be expensive but we ordered a private fridge to the room and used that. ,50,0
59,"So this is a very large, very busy and very impressive hotel. However, if you are looking for the personal touch, this is not the hotel for you.The pool is the undoubted highlight, and wasn't too busy which was surprising. Service was good overall as were the restaurants we tried. The room was surprisingly basic given the rest of the hotel, it was fine don't get me wrong, but a bit sparse and decoration was not what you would expect. Not the sort of place I would stay for a long period, but for a couple of nights, it offers something quote different.",50,1
60,"Stayed here last year. As a spectacle it's unbeatable... The only gripe, the room itself didn't really scream luxury. It was a little standard. At a hotel like this you'd expect a certain style type and quirks. It seems they put everything into the architecture instead.I will be back to try the pool.PS - I didn't fair well at all at the casino... ",40,1
61,"This hotel and the surrounding shops and attractions could keep you busy for days.  The hotel itself is a marvel of architecture.  It is pricey for what you get, BUT, we only stayed there to be able to get up to the infinity pool and the MBS skywalk is included in the room price.  It was worth it just to be able to swim and take pics from the infinity pool.  A great view of the Gardens By the Bay just next door.  The connecting shops are huge and very upscale and trendy.  Many good restaurants in the complex.  If you want to eat on the cheap - there is a very good food court downstairs in the shops.  Of course the casino will be an attraction to a lot of folks.  Although I didn't gamble, I walked around the casino and it was laid out very nice.  The highlights of this stay for me, (and you don't have to stay at the hotel to experience but it is certainly convenient), were the light shows at Gardens By the Bay and the spectacular laser/light show in front of the MBS hotel.  Both shows twice nightly and both free.  It is worth a walk onto the helix bridge next door to the hotel to get spectacular views of the hotel and surrounding areas.",40,1
62,"Service is NON existence in this hotel.. Where to start?  I am in the HOTEL at the time writing this review (11/18. 10.39am Room 4225 check it out)The so call executive club is a joke, they are nothing more than a cafe in the 55 floor.  Beside serving you food, there practically can do nothing for you.  I forget my card, and they cannot even let you go back to the floor of your room, so you have to walk from Tower 2, all the way to the front lobby just to have your them issue you a card.  Unlike Ritz Carlton or Mandarin their executive club is able to provide you with a full range of services.Next my baby girl spilled milk over HERSELF and the high chair.  So I thought the waitress (Mina) would go and get some napkin for me to clean up the baby.  Instead the first thing she did was to clean the highchair, leaving my baby girl covered in milk.  Luckily her colleague has more senses to offer us napkin to clean her up.  So the high chair is more valuable than the babyThen we have guest in the room, so we called the ""Express Service"" (yes there is a button on the phone that say Express Service and you are to place your request there) to ask for 2 more wine glasses.  It took them 50 mins and after 3 repeated calls before they finally send over.  So much for ""express service""Lastly the free wi-fi speed is laughable  A simple google search took more than 1 min to load.Over for this price, I would not recommended it",40,1
63,"This hotel is among the best I have visited. This is the type of hotel where someone literally do not need to leave because it has it all. They are built adjacent to a casino and high end shopping mall with numerous restaurants with all cuisines. They also have that beautiful infinity pool which everyone already know. Our room type is premier room with harbor view. It is wonderful, spacious, with comfortable bed and pillow. There are multiple breakfast option available. Meaning you can choose from 3 restaurants as you like. The options are Rise (ground floor), Spago (57th floor), and Adrift (ground floor). During our 4 days stay, we had the first day breakfast at Spago and the following days always at Rise. Spago is very popular. The breakfast at Spago started at 7am. By 7:30 am on Saturday we were there and we have to wait 15 minutes already. The whole process at Spago reception is highly inefficient and took unnecessary wasted time. So they will ask your room number, last name, matched in in their computer to check if your room rates include breakfast or not, then they will give small notes and passed it to table server whom then guides you to the table.The next day we had breakfast at Rise. The whole experience is different (minus the 57th floor view) but i’d say i would prefer Rise more than Spago because of the waiting time.Now the negative side. The check in proccess took forever. I mean the queue is extremely long. I spent more than 1 hour standing in line to check in. Luckily they allow us to enter the room at 1 pm (check in time 3pm). This hotel also feels impersonal. This is my third time staying at this hotel but not once I got greeted by name. In other 5 stars establishment such as ritz carlton, fullerton or shangri la, the employee recognize us and call us by name. Maybe because it’s an entertainment focused hotel and its just business as usual for them.Tip:- There are 2 check in counters available. In Tower 1 & Tower 3. From our previous experience Tower 3 has less waiting time.- go to the infinity pool by 6 am and enjoy sunrise at the beautiful pool almost by yourself. Worth the early morning wake up!",10,1
64,The building has to be one of the worlds most iconic and the room and top floor infinity pool were equal to expectations....brilliant! The room was huge and fully specked out with all you could ask including multiple USB charging points. Our room was on the 46th floor and had a spectacular view as building curved and undercut beneath us. The pool deck is second to none and is a MUST DO. the view from the 150m infinity pool edge was mesmerizing. We were reluctant to return to Singapore as it is just tooooo capatalistic but as we had a conference here we had to come and staying at the Marina Sands made it a special trip indeed.,40,1
65,"This hotel is a must see and stay when you visit Singapore. The awe of this hotel and shopping complex as it towers over the marina is simply stunning. The lobby is stunning and ensure you check which desk you will be checking into before arriving as each tower has its own check in counter. Each room is set out perfectly and the lead in room (which is the most basic that the hotel has to offer) is amazing. Very spacious with great views and all including a bath. The garden view rooms are not to be overlooked as the night show of the gardens of the bay is beautiful to watch from your balcony. There is plenty to do at this hotel with the skypark having the beautiful and extremely large pool on the roof, which has plenty of space for guests, the casino, plenty of shopping and restaurants and a train station underneath the hotel which allows you to go out and explore the city easy. We will be back for sure to this hotel on any stopover in Singapore. ",50,1
66,"This hotel is a gem, but beside it architecture is the service that reach a very high standard in excellence. Treat yourself with a package that include the club 55 access you wouldn’t regret it : no queue for breakfast or dinner and enjoy the unique view of this private club. Millions of comments have already made about the infinity pool and of course it is breathtaking! As every success it has a bad side : it is crowded all the time. But Singapore has so much to offer so once you made that famous picture, no need to come back and fight to get a place in the pool. We had a specially smooth and great premium experience by getting picked up at the airport, checking made directly in the room. Thank you very much to all the staff which is one of the best I ever see. ",50,1
67,"A great place to walk out and get some sunshine on a flying visit to Singapore. Beautiful views, lovely choice of food & drink and shops as museums pretty much. Top tip do the bar option for $20 for the views at the top, all redeemable against the menu, good service, great choices and all the views anyway! ",50,1
68,"I have had the pleasure of staying at many different hotels, but my goodness, this hotel tops all of them as the most amazing hotel ever. The staff here really knows what they are doing to help their guests feel welcome. I am not sure where to even begin. When my room was cleaned a small bag with a few valuables was accidentally thrown in the trash, when I expressed my concern the staff went to the trash and found the bag and brought it back!!!!! IT was amazing ! When two kids who were unattended throughout the elevators and the pool area made me get hurt by the elevator, the hotel offered free breakfast and free VIP private luxury car to take my mother and I to the airport for our departure. This is the type of hotel that Marina Bay Sands is. I live in Los Angeles and I go to Singapore on weekend trips often and I will ALWAYS STAY AT MARINA BAY SANDS !!!!KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.",50,1
69,"I have been with my family to this hotel in Singapore and the service was impeccable, since we arrived at the airport. We did the transfer directly with the hotel, so there was a lady waiting literarily outside on the plane, and helped us until the security to show passports. Then the car was so luxurious, the check in was smoothly, we entered on the garage so did not do the check in at the main reception/ The room was huge, my both children were sleeping on the sofa bed, and the toilet was so big, that we could have shower all at same time, so we can imagine how bit. Infinity poor was overcrowded some days but a must. You need to take your room key so you can go inside, you have robes in the room, and towels upstairs on the 57th floor where infinity pool was.Lifts you need to use your room key unless you're going to reception or to the top floor. People who are not staying in the hotel can go to the restaurants upstairs to have a meal or a drink. I stayed on the tower 1, so the lift is straight to the 57th flood, but not sure about the other towers. Have seen on the check in, other people being offered either water bottle, ice creams or a smoothies whilst they were waiting.They replace everyday the water bottles in your room. There were 3 options to have breakfast, one spago which is next to the infinity poor and the wait is normally around 20 minutes queuing. Even when we arrived at 7 am in the morning there were people already waiting. Then you have on the ground floor the Rise and the Adrift. The rise has far more options but the Adrift seemed more cosy. On the 3 of them you can order all kinds of eggs (you have a list) and the take into your table when it's ready. I had 2 children sleeping in my room, so from 6 years old they have to pay at the hotel for their breakfast (was not included on the room rate- ours was, and under 5 was complimentary).From our room you could see the city and the aqua show that is every night Spectra runs on Mon-Thu & Sun at 8pm and 9pm, and on Fri & Sat at 8pm, 9pm and 10pm.You should try the Singapore Sling is a gin-based cocktail from Singapore. Lots of different restaurant options",50,1
70,"Stayed in this hotel with my wife and two kids in the second half of October 2018 for two nights.  We stayed in a family suite.  Although family suites are located on lower floors, they offer a great value. Rooms are huge, bathrooms are very nice, and terrace is absolutely wonderful.  We had an issue with outside noise during our first night as terrace doors did not work properly.  Despite being full on the weekend the hotel found us another room, which was great. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and stay there again.",50,1
71,"Stayed for 4 nights at a one bedroom Suite, 30 Oct to 03 Nov. The room cleaner always made sure our room was very comfortable to stay in. She always leaves different animal towels for our kids and they loved it. She cleans very well but does not understand english, her name is Ms. Yu Lan Qi. Everything was perfect and we really enjoyed our stay. Will be back again.",50,1
72,"I stayed here for staycation with my friend. This beautiful & unique hotel is ideally located. Great atmosphere, great service! Check-in was smooth as silk. From the moment we checked in, we were treated like a valued guest even though we hadn’t stayed there before. We were warmly greeted by Ms Jessica from the Reception who is charismatic & friendly. We were assigned room on Tower 3 overlooking the beautiful Gardens by The Bay. Nice room, very spacious & was kept spotless by the housekeeper. The infinity pool is the main highlight. Don’t forget to bring your key card. No card no entry. We really had a great time. Thank you everyone from MBS for making this stay a memorable one! ",50,1
73,Just checked in at the marina bay sands. Not impressed!! The room has a very bad smell & is basic room for the price you pay. I’ve had a better rooms on the beach of Thailand. I asked for a harbour view room which you have to pay extra for instead of the garden view & once I arrived both rooms actually mean the same!!!  Very confusing wording on the room view options. When I rang the reception to complain about the terrible smell & view they didn’t offer to change my view only my room due to the smell. No offer of a complimentary. For a room that you pay over £500 a night for I really wouldn’t bother staying here,50,0
74,"We stayed for just a night as we wanted to experience the infinity pool, but with the awesome room we had, we found ourselves enthralled by the amazing views of both the city from the main room and the gardens from the bathroom.  We made it up to the pool at sunset and it was everything we had hoped.  Not sure I would stay here regularly with the cost, but as an occasional treat it is well worth it!",10,1
75,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of our stop over through Singapore just to say we’ve “stayed there” - so glad we did!! Every little part of MBS was pure luxury, caring about all the details.Check in was great - got a room upgrade to one of the club rooms on the 49th floor! Amazing bath, two sinks, beautiful view of marina bay. We were greeted by cute towel animal art too!Floors were immaculately clean for carpet.Go to the infinity pool before 8am - especially if you want to properly swim. They take out the lap lane by about 9am. Sun loungers IN the pool and poolside service - all with a beautiful view.MRT is underneath so if you want to save on dining - just a short 5min trip will bring you to food and shopping more than half the price. Gym - got protein shakes at the end of our session complimentary! Great view high up on 55th floor and good mainly cardio equipment and some free and machine weights.Highly recommend!",50,1
76,"Stayed at MBS Hotel Tower 2- premier city view room 3250 from 14-16Nov. Had an extremely pleasant stay at this hotel, everything was up to and even exceeded expectations. Staff are hospitable and friendly, and service feels warm, personal and genuine. Bathroom is very big and makes me feel like a palace whenever I step inside. Infinity pool @ 57th floor has more than enough space for everyone and it is an enjoyable experience to look out at the city, especially at night. Fitness centre @ 55th floor has a full range of state-of-the-art gym equipment with city views and is the best gym I can ever ask for, the sauna and hot pool is simply relaxing and allows me to meditate peacefully as I throw my troubles out of this world. Room is extremely spacious and is able to accommodate up to 8 ppl for gatherings, and has a table to eat and play card games/mahjong. Would like to thank and send regards to staff who had went out of their way to accommodate my requests and make my stay an enjoyable one such as by delivering whatever I requested to my room within 5 minutes, and I would also like to comment that the city view from the room (provided you stay 30th floor and above) is simply breathtaking. Would definitely come back here for another visit",50,1
77,"Marina Bay Sands is a modern icon of Singapore and is one of the most spectacular hotels, especially from the rooftop infinity pool and garden, that you could find.  It is packed with restaurants, a casino, shopping centre, conference facilities and adjacent to the gardens and bayfront area.Rooms have spectacular views too but are on the basic side for a luxury hotel.  Service was also a bit below top 5 star levels found elsewhere in Singapore - aka the superb Raffles, e.g. No turn down service, no minibar, poor WiFi and waiting on hold for in room dining to answer - but the quality of food was very good when it arrived!",50,1
78,"The hotel is in a perfect location, you have access to the shops and the restaurants which is amazing, you also can walk right over to the gardens by the bay which is such a sight to see. But the hotel lacks hospitality, and service. The rooms are kinda small, compared to a New York or a Paris size room, and I guess my disappointments are really in the hospitality with the staff. We stayed here to check out the pool, we had 2 nights in Singapore and you cannot visit the pool unless you’re a guest or the hotel, which is rightfully so. The views on the rooftop were amazing. We e joyed our time in Singapore but was disappointed with this resort. I really thought they could have been better.",40,1
79,"The hotel is an icon and a stay here is unforgettable as it is such an unusual experience. We stayed here for 8 nights in April and enjoyed a room towards the city skyline with a great view. The pool area is a crazy scene with people posing to their mobile phone all the time and the lounge music filling the air in 190 meters height. The breakfast is equally an unusual experience as you have to get up early when the breakfast restaurants (the one on the pool floor is the best!) opens to avoid waiting too long in a line. Waiting in line soon becomes part of the experience at Marina Bay Sands, which makes it a bit tivoli like. The breakfast was good though. We had dinner 4 times at Lavo, the restaurant situated on the pool level, and it was a great experience (and magnificent views). We also used the gym which was excellent. The floor level with more (breakfast) restaurants and access to the shopping areas was not my taste. Crowded and not very charming. Shopping area is almost all Gucci / Versace like shops and nothing I would spend money on. Getting a taxi out of the Marina Bay Sands area also requires waiting in a line for a long time. So bring lots of patience :-)",30,1
80,"Check in was a bit slow and i understand due to number of guest.Hotel was impressive inside.Very accomodating staff upon entry.Manage to get a high floor with a nice garden view.The exciting part was the pool,but the downside was you need to bring your hotel card each person.We only bring one card just to see the pool at around 530pm,but the staff was very accomodating to let us in just asking our room number and are we a valid guest.They are very polite and with a smile to us...Pool was great and we manage to find a place near to the pool.When we exit we must tap in the card again just like in a subway..Special mention to the staff at the gate rachel and dennis who was very friendly and  remembering us upon exit,as i joke with them that im James Bond.:)very impressive service..Keep it up..",40,1
81,gorgeous hotel and the staff couldn't do enough to help. I recommend cocktails in Ce la Vie the views are beyond belief.... pricey but worth it! and the light show at 8pm is not to be missed. great thing to do if you are not resident in the hotel is buy a visitor pass and it's redeemable on drinks ,50,1
82,"Fastest check-out experience ever. Just drop your keys and form at the designated boxes and you're done! Ours was a high floor corner room in Tower 3 and it offered the best view of the sea, the city, Marina Barrage, and the Gardens by the Bay. It's the best location to just relax and lounge and marvel at the beautiful landscape before you. You get a free access to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark when you book a room--just tap your room keycard upon entering. The best part for us was swimming in the infinity pool and getting the best seat in the house for the light show! You'll never get tired looking at the jaw dropping view of the Singapore skyline. It's really romantic!",50,1
83,"Right now I am lounging at the infinity pool and this is truly spectacular. It is definitely worth to pay up to enjoy staying at this iconic hotel. Even better, by signing up for the Sands membership before you book the hotel, you can enjoy the members rate for as low as S$299, which, is about 50% of the rate I found anywhere else. There are no bad rooms. The garden view is really the garden/ocean view, while the city view allows you a view of the city and at nights a great view of the water and light show. You are here to enjoy the infinity pool, breakfast on the 57th floor, open air at Spago, where you can see the sunrise in a a chic outdoor setting while eating great food.Also, the hotel is a few steps from the Gardens by the Bay, another must see visit while here in Singapore (skip the Orchid Gardens which are under going expansion until your next visit).The restaurants may be pricey but you are getting only nutrition, its the experience.Did I mention to make sure you spend time at the pool enjoying the infinity experience.",50,1
84,"Oh my.. picture looks so perfect but when you start to queue in for your check in - you will lose patience but at least there is a hotel staff who offers water and juices while you wait which means to say that it will be a forever/long time in the queue . When you pay 700$ Singaporean dollar per night- I was expecting more for the service. Hotel lobby - I kid you not- the worse look/design I’ve ever seen for a 5 star hotel- I’ll grade it as a 1 star out of 5. It is just like walking in to a tacky restaurant where there is no wow factor.After checking in-  the elevator service was another wait. I guest with the amount of tourist that they have- our wait time to get in the elevator was close to 5 minutes.Room was a good size/decent size - air conditioning could be better, we have a patio overlooking the Gardens of the Bay. Free complimentary water Access to the pool was another challenge- switch with another elevator, then you have to wait again and then you have to badge in and badge out when you enter the pool- just like an employee. Not sure on how they can improved on this but it gives you the cheapest feeling of swimming in the pool. There should be a better way on dealing with this - considering the technology that they have.the infinity pool has the excellent view of the city so it is a must to see.Overall satisfaction-2/5. I prefer to stay in another hotel but because my friends insisted to have the pool experience that’s why we ended here. All I can say - the hotel could be better or needs to do a lot of improvement. For me- it is not worth the price!",50,1
85,"An amazing hotel, in a great location. Very spacious rooms (we had one facing the city, and the other one facing the harbour). Clean, very quiet, and very large bath room.   The great rooftop pool is something hard to describe.Although this hotel runs more like a large plant, it still is a very high ranked hotel.",20,1
86,"If you ever plan to travel to Singapore, partly business, partly pleasure, pick Marina Bay Sands!Firstly: what a gorgeous architecture!Secondly: if you didn’t live here, you would come here after all!Because it all happens here: the wonderful infinity pool, the 2 o’clock tea, the 5 o’clock champagne and gardens by the bay and all the fantastic light and music shows!So friendly, so clean, so beautiful!",50,1
87,"beautiful experience, wonderful suite with double view. Excellent service and excellent customer care. Wonderful bed with city view, fantastic bathroom with shower and tub facing the sea view. The night is a wonderful show. Cavalli's personal care products. Espresso machine in the living room with a wide selection of blends. Absolutely to try at least once in life.",50,1
88,I wish I could have stayed or I can stay in the future at the hotel :) Beautiful background. Beautiful lights,50,1
89,"They say that “as long as your hotel room is clean and tidy that’s all you need when your on holidays, save your money for spending” !!! .. NO WAY !, in my view you get what you pay for and staying in the right hotel can either make or break your holiday. I have stayed in some amazing, luxurious hotels all around the world but the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is a cut above all the rest.You really don’t need to leave the resort if you don’t want to, everything is under 1 roof. A huge variety of restaurants and bars, shops, coffee houses, casino, and many services not to mention the Gardens by the bay and the laser light show.From the moment you step inside the doors you start to soak up the luxury of it all, not cheap by any means ( approx. price per night can vary from $460-$1000), we stayed in a delux room above the 40th floor so we could see the laser show and have a city view ... it was worth every cent. The line when checking in is ridiculously long and wait time extensive but 9/10 customers were all given early access to their rooms once checked in so that was great. The service was fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. We stayed in tower 3, so once checked in we went up to our room, opening the door it was a real pleasant surprise, the rooms are equivalent to a suite in any other hotel, huge, airy and delightful, a lounge suite 2 tv’s, a beautiful bathroom, and electronic curtains that open when you place your key card in the slot on entry. Roof to floor glass windows so you can see the city... and wow what a view. After exploring our room we decided the infinity pool was a must as you only have access if you are a guest, outside guests are not permitted entry.. so off we went. It did not disappoint... absolutely jaw dropping, the most remarkable pool iv ever seen, infinity is an understatement, it goes on for ever, the sweeping views of Singapore are extraordinary. If your over due for some pampering and relaxation I highly recommend this property.. I could not faulter it. Magnificent.",50,1
90,"I was celebrating a very special occasion with my wife and daughter and I really wanted to make it exciting for my young daughter who was super thrilled when she got to know that we were doing a staycation at MBS . The lady who was  checking us  in   was very polite and despite her best intentions ended up committing an error and I was really touched how they tried to make it good  . Unheard of in the Industry . This shows what makes a property great. During my brief stay I tried to make use of the Coffee House RENKO , LOVO the italian restaurant and the fine dining wing of SPAGO and I must say I was happy with all 3 . The premier room that I had booked was made special when they gave me an upgrade. The staff delivered special cake for this special occasion and we left with memories which will last for ever. Check out was really smooth and fast. For such a prestigious property they should have a better gym . Infinity Pool was really crowded but I expected it to be so . I have visited CE Lavi and the viewing galleries earlier. I think the SET Lunch at LOVO is quite reasonable priced for such a lovely view . Negative ...this hotel seriously lacks privacy .",40,1
91,"This is hands down the best hotel I've stayed in to date. The attention to detail is evident throughout the entire stay. I've never come across a more friendly staff, all of whom genuinely care about you enjoying your time with them. I ordered room service several times and the food was great. I didn't dine at the restaurants directly inside the hotel, as I did find them extremely pricey, however there are plenty of options for dining in the adjoining shopping mall. My room had views of the gardens which was beautiful day and night. For being a large property, it doesn't take long to walk to different attractions like it does one some Vegas properties. Really enjoyed the bridge you can take directly to the Gardens by the Bay. The pool view and service at the lounge chairs is to die for.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Would stay here again and again.",50,1
92,"The receptionist did very well and polite , nice atmosphere , nice view from the top  i will stay here again when i come back to singapore . In the morning , you should go to the swimming pool to relax , it was really awesome.",50,1
93,"This place is great if you love huge (and I mean huge) modern hotels. We arrived straight from a cruise and were able to check in to the club room that we had reserved which was nice - not having to wait. The room was huge, great views of the inner bay and on the other side the amazing gardens (do visit these if you go). We loved level 55 for breakfast and pre dinner drinks both included in our package, also of course we swam in the iconic pool, but beware it’s not a restful experience, as no matter what time of day you go there it’s always packed. We ate in some of the restaurants there, the best being Spago, but very expensive. The casino was huge and mainly aimed at the Chinese market, we found it odd that everyone is still allowed to smoke in there, so we didn’t stay long. Overall a great experience and I would not hesitate to recommend it to Anyone.",50,1
94,"We stayed here for 1 night on our first night in Singapore. We were tested to a room upgrade to the Orchid Suite and they accommodated our request to be in the same block as friends who were staying as well. Great service from the get go!The suite was enormous and the views of the city were breathtaking from the 54th floor! The freestanding bath was also an added perk.We shot up to the 57th to try out the infinity pool and that also lived up the hype. We caught a glorious sunset and it wasn't as busy as we thought it would be. One other tip is to head to the hot tubs on the garden side to see the gardens by the bay light show at 7.45pm from above. Another tip is to wake up early and get to the pool for opening time to enjoy it all to yourselves. We got there at 6.30 and enjoyed about 20 mins of bliss before others arrived!Overall, its definitely worth a stay. One night is enough but it truly won't disappoint.",40,1
95,"I have to say I’ve been to Singapore before and was in awe of this hotel the minute I saw it. So promised next time we went we would stay there. So we did and got the most amazing upgrade free of charge into a suite. It had a grand piano karaoke room gym hair salon , 5 toilets !!! It was amazing. The staff where all friendly and couldn’t have done more for us and even without the upgrade the hotel is magical and worth every penny. The food was great at the top in Wolfgang restaurant. Enjoyed every minute",50,1
96,"We stayed here for our last night of our holiday traveling in Singapore as a treat after visiting the bar on our last trip. We stayed on the 30th floor with views across the Gardens by the Bay, room lovely and big and th balcony with view gave it a feel above the average. The infinity pool on the roof is amazing, particularly at night with Singapore lit up before it. Plenty of loungers and staff on hand to assist, some great photo opportunities. We viewed the stay as an event in itself and it really excelled itself.",50,1
97,"Don’t get me wrong, the building is interesting and full of proposals, including the well known swimming pool on the roof and on the city or the close by garden with built trees. The location is for sure interesting. And so the view. But no real charm, long time to get a breakfast, the intimacy of a station, the impression to be in a commercial centre, more than in the hall of an Hôtel. Maybe better to visit than to stay in",50,1
98,"I have high expectations so when staying here in one of the sands suites I wondered if it would match up.From being collected at changi airport in a blacked out suv to private check in and your own butler marina bay sands exceeded my expectations.A very generous sized suite with pool table,large dining table and even larger lounge area, a very generous sized bedroom and a bathroom bigger than some hotel rooms.The butler service was exceptional, it was our anniversary while we stayed there and our butler came to turn down the room and Offered to run my wife a bath she then spent 15 minutes placing individual rose petals on top of the bubbles.Room service was also very attentive.The rooftop infinity pool is a sight to behold at night overlooking the sprawling Singapore skyline.Although a suite is expensive in comparison to a standard room it’s worth every penny",30,1
99,We stayed here for our last night of our holiday traveling round South East Asia and what a treat that was. Check in was quick and we were upgraded to a room on the 47th floor the room was spacious and very clean we had a small balcony overlooking the gardens by the bay. All the staff are friendly and the breakfast had lots of choices there are 3 restaurants to chose from for breakfast we had ours at Rise. The infinity pool on the roof was amazing plenty of sun loungers and lots of staff taking food and drinks orders there are 3 jacuzzis on the rooftop aswell. There is a shopping mall attached to the hotel with plenty of places to eat. I would definitely recommend staying here,50,1
100,Really a great hotel and a great experience. Although the number of guest is huge you get individual treatment and perfect service. Location is perfect to discover Singapore. Take the view from the pool and decide where to go o4 stay there and enjoy.,50,1
101,This was a experience of a lifetime.  You will find more luxurious hotels but not an experience like this. The scale was incredible and the room was very pleasant.  The highlight was the rooftop swimming pool.  The changing facilities were not great but the overall experience was phenomenal - great views and a novel place to swim.The shopping center on site was amazing.,50,1
102,"I've been to singapore this summer with my mom. I reserved this hotel becasue it's serving as a not only hotel, but landmark of singapore. This hotel is easy to approach because it's connected with subway station, but the whole building is huge that you might lose your way.Once you check in the hotel you will surprise because the sight of the hotel room is so good (you can see Botanic garen, but it depends on what room you get). Also, Infinity Pool on the top of the building is very good. During the night you can see the fantastic night view of Singapore, also food on the loof top is not bad. I know the fee is very expensive, but it's worth it.",50,1
103,"Last night I was fortunate to dine at ‘Spago’ which ultimately became an enjoyable experience. Despite my regular appearances in this part of the world, somewhat naively, I requested an outside table with the idea that the view from the 57th Floor would be amazing and it is! However, the heat & humidity is not geared to eating outside even here and even more annoyingly, all the men, women & children swimming and making lots of noise in the adjacent infinity pool also think it’s good to look at you, your table and food. The Restaurant team (Mike The Maitre’D or one of and the fabulous Anqur came to my rescue and as quickly as possible found me a table inside this very classy restaurant with first class food & service. So, please visit but ask for an inside table if you are to enjoy your experience at this superb venue",50,1
104,"This hotel was a true experience... I fulfilled my screen saver goal staying here!! The location was the best.. walking distance to the train and is attached to Gardens by the Bay. My room has an amazing view of the River and of the light show. Remote control blackout curtains was my favorite part. Hotel staff was also amazing, food was on point!!! I will stay here again.. Highly recommended",50,1
105,Great area and one of Singapore iconic building! Lots of shops and restaurants. Lots of thing to do in Marina Bay! You will never get bored and highly recommended !,50,1
106,"The Marina Bay Sands building is iconic, beautiful and it dominates the Singapore skyline. Expectations are high, but they are met by attentive staff who are there to ensure that every request is met to ensure that guests feel spoiled and completely indulged.The hotel is clean and every expectation was met. No complaints here of missing amenities or dirty rooms. This was a fabulous experience.",50,1
107,"I spent one full day by just roaming around the marina bay. The view, lots of tourist and specially view at night make it super cool place . But the prices around the restaurant over there was bit crazy high . cool place . ",50,1
108,"Yes it is enormous and located in the perfect spot, but it is too big. The rooms are just normal hotel rooms nothing spectacular but they are clean and of course have spectacular views because of the location. The rooftop pools are amazing but not really for swimming as everyone is there to take selfies. Glad I stayed there once however probably wouldn’t go back.",50,1
109,"This hotel is a must even if for one night.  We stayed one night and definitely amazing though wouldn't go back again.  Let me explained.  This hotel is just massive, three hotels in one, only 20 minutes from the airport by taxi around $15-$20 Singapore. You have to make sure you tell the taxi driver which tower otherwise you will have a big walk to the correct lobby.  A big tip is within 24 hours of arriving you can book in online.  This will save you massive amounts of time in the line.  If there is a big line which there was when we arrived I just asked a staff member that I had booked online and he put me straight into the checkout counter.  Ask for an upgrade we did get one which was nice, was our first time so that could have been why.  The rooms are nice and clean though the shower wasn't very good considering the cost of the room.   Of course, you must check out the pool and go for a swim and get the selfie.  This is where its the strangest pool experience I've ever had and I love pools.  Everyone is just taking photos and the pool area in and out of the pool is packed.  So if you just want to relax its not really that type of pool. But simply incredible. There are people that will take photos for you in the pool so look out for them.  Pool drinks and the food is expensive but so is Singapore $16 for a beer.   The staff were very friendly and helpful and make sure you go to the bakery at tower three, amazing sweets and coffee good prices too.   When I booked I was caught between the city view and the harbor park view.  In the end, it came down to price, so went for Harbour garden view.  Awesome.  So I can't compare the city view but you can easily get that from the pool, day and night. Garden view you get to see the harbor as well.  Another tip, checkout using the self-checkout card, really easy and convenient. Overall an amazing hotel but lots of people and more of an experience than a romantic stay or chill hotel.  Definitely, do it for one night if you haven't been before.",30,1
110,If you are looking for the most posh place to stay in Singapore the Marina Bay Sands should be on you top 3 list. They definitely will not disappoint you with the lush hotel rooms and day/night swimming in the infinity pool and all the best sights and scenery around the city. I suggest you check the bookings availability every now and then to find deals and choose mid week not weekend.,50,1
111,"So far, Singapore is the cleanest place I have ever visited. There are a thousand and one things to do in Singapore and more than a thousand and one places to visit. One of these is Marina Bay Sands. The place is just totally mesmerizing! To fully comprehend what I mean, just go now! Take a break from your work, book a flight, and go!",50,1
112,We visited Singapore as a family from Melbourne and Marina Bay Sands has definitely met our high expectations! The room was a generous size with all the facilities you’d expect. Beautiful shops and restaurants at our doorstep. The staff very friendly and accommodating. A special mention to life guard Ryan Goh at the Infinity pool who was so friendly and offered to take family photos for us! The level57 Sky deck and pool was spectacular and breathtaking. Nothing like it anywhere else. Worth staying here just for this experience! Regards Patricia,50,1
113,Beautiful resort and casino. Singapore has a very strict rules as far gambling for their citizens. foreigners have to show and leave their passports showing that they are not residents. the country does not want them to get the gambling bug. The resort has every exclusive shops anyone can desire. they have a Ice skating also. You can even rent high end exotic cars to experience at the time approx. $250.00 . Sounded interesting but we didn't have time to schedule that.Plus all the usual amenities the other resorts would have just a cut above. As far as when we there it was back 2014. i don't think any has changed since then.,50,1
114,"A luxury hotel, different from where a normal person is used to stay. All facilities were good, from the food services to the luggage store. The room was clean, which is quite fundamental for me and is not as commonplace as one can suppose, even among many stars-hotels.My husband and I enjoyed also a poolside dinner and a breakfast and we found them really good, especially the breakfast, which was abundant, diversified and very good quality.The spectacular sight, both from the pool and from our 39thFloor-room added points to the hotel and allows, for me, the achievement of the fifth star.",50,1
115,"Among best hotels in Singapore, we have often chosen to stay at the impressive Marina Bays Sand.I especially would like to express my thanks to Mr Eric at the check in counter. I lucky have meet him 2 times. He is so helpful ❤️",50,1
116,The architecture is very unique and beautiful. It can be seen from almost anywhere in Singapore. Very huge resort. The swimming pool at the top is very impressive and so was the view. Very polite and helpful staff. From the top you can get a view of the Gardens by the Bay,50,1
117,"We stayed here for just one night last week for a stopover in Singapore. We have always wanted to stay in the hotel, but agreed that one night was enough. I must say that there were many positives with our stay:- We arrived at 9:30am when the check-in time was 3pm. We went in asking if we could just leave our bags, but they allowed us to check-in, even though our room wasn't ready we were really pleased as it allowed us to avoid the queues later on. - The room was lovely, we had a premier harbour view room which I would highly recommend. You see a lot of the city from the infinity pool, so having a harbour view allowed us a different perspective from the room, and a view of gardens by the bay and beyond. Bathroom was beautiful!- We ate our dinner at Spago by Wolfgang Puck, and had the tasting menu. It was delicious, and the waiters were very knowledgeable and attentive. Furthermore, quality of food and drinks at the pool side were great.However - there were also disappointments for us, and I do believe that the hotel is becoming a victim of it's own success. It is so large and so sought after (mainly for the infinity pool), it is hard to offer a true 5* personal service. At times, the crowds became tiresome.- The infinity pool was beautiful, and the view was everything we thought it would be - however it was packed and difficult at times to find 2 sun loungers together. It wasn't very relaxing to swim along either as you always felt you were going to ruin someones Instagram post. Even at 6am as soon as it opened the best seats were taken.- Breakfast in Spago was average - and I would not say a 5* standard, . We queued for 10minutes to get in at 7:05 in the morning (restaurant only opened at 7). This wasn't due to volume of people or lack of tables, but due to an inefficient process. Every guest we saw was asked as they entered for their room number (nothing new there), they then looked you up on a system, confirmed if your breakfast was included in the room rate, then wrote out a hand written slip with your room number and name - gave it to another waiter who would then show you to your seat. This seemed unnecessary, and slowed up the whole process.All in all, I am very pleased that we stayed here and did have a lovely time - it is well worth a stay to say you've been. However if you want a true 5* hotel, I would look elsewhere.",50,1
118,"This is one of the iconic hotels in Singapore. Must stay at least 2 nights to enjoy the upper deck observatory it gives you an awesome view of Marina area, Singapore river, Raffle’ Place, City Hall and Merlion area and of course the infinity pool exclusively to hotel guests, it’s a great way to relax with a city view evening time and early morning. Explore below The Shoppes for luxurious brands, coffee & tea shops, and the latest show at Mastercard theatre. Don’t forget to try out local food at the food court - Rasapura. There’s a laser/fountain show every night and it’s free, do check the timing online! ",30,1
119,"Stayed here again last month - the last time was couple years back?Lobby space has gone less spacious with more and more empty spaces getting popups everywhere, made the place look more crowdedWifi is actually quite terrible - for MBS standards I would have expected better. Either it's difficult / unable to connect, or just basically slow. Unless it's wee hours.Rooms are basically well-maintained, nothing much has changed, still fresh clean rooms. Still a very good choice of hotel if you're not picky about Wifi.",50,1
120,Jeremiah LMalaysia427Reviewed yesterdayRETURNVery helpful staff during checkin. Room was clean and bright Given Tower 3 . Good view. Working table was of good size. The maintenance staff was efficient when have problem with the toilet. Came to the room within 7 minutes after my call. Towels was replace and changed daily. After I check out I realize I lexft my diary in the room after 6 days. Call the hotel and was requested to have a report taken over the phone. Very efficient got an email message that my diary was found with all the cash intact. Offer to forward back to me but since I am visiting Singapore again for a business trip decided to pick it up myself. Collection was very efficient and staff handling was polite.,50,1
121,"I stayed for one night here.I decide to upgrade to Club55 area, so I got a bigger room and access to the Club55 with canapés at evening and all free drinks (incl. champagne) also amazing breakfast. Additional here should tea time for Club55 members.The hotel is really really big, so long distance from reception and depends which tower (1 or 2 or 3) you are staying.I arrived arround 6ich (pm) and no waiting time at check in. The room was not really high floor but really big and even if daily change of guest I did not see this in the room.I took a room with view into city, also they offer view to gardens and Harbour.The bathroom was amazing big with shower room and bathtub.Access to Infinity Pool until 10pm.Also you can use gym.All staff was amazing helpful (reception, house-keeping, concierge and restaurants).",50,1
122,"Yes it’s huge, yes it’s expensive but honestly I would say it’s such a unique experience that it’s worth it. The swimming pool is just incredible, we went around 9 o clock in the morning and it wasn’t too crowded with plenty of sun beds available. However it’s a different story at night when it does get extremely busy. The other side of the pool deck is a lot quieter and has jacuzzis and plenty of shady spots. Drinks at the bar were excessively expensive but you were paying for the surroundings I guess. We didn’t have the buffet breakfast so can’t comment on it but we did go to the coffee shop/ bakery in the atrium and it was very reasonable.It’s impossible to get a personal service from such a large hotel but every member of staff we met was extremely helpful, friendly and polite. There’s a lot of walking involved if you stay here, getting from your room to the taxi rank or the shopping mall can take some time even though the lifts are very fast. The city view rooms are breathtaking, especially the higher floors. ",50,1
123,Iconic hotel very good public areas staff are amazing location superb had a club floor room which was very spacious and modern plenty of light and great views.Very good transport connections with the MRT and local buses.Great selection of restaurants close by.,50,1
124,"We stayed 1 night in this hotel because I wanted to swim in the rooftop pool. It was a very expensive swim but definitely  worth it. We had a room on the 45th floor in Tower 1 facing the bay. We were able to check in early and get access to the pool even though our room was not ready. TIP, keep your swimmers in a day bag not your luggage. We stayed at the pool for 5 hours , relaxing, having drinks and poolside lunch. We eventually went down to check out our room and it was amazing, huge, a great view with floor to ceiling glass. It was so nice and relaxing we decided to have room service and just enjoy the light show on the bay.  The bathroom is huge with a lovely big bath. The service at check in and out was very good. Would I stay here again, probably not, because for me it was all about the pool and I have been there and done that, but i would certainly recommend paying the price to swim in the pool or for a special occasion.",50,1

126,"Great Place, really impressive architecture, walking distance to the Sky Garden and central Singapore. The pool on the cantilever roof is fantastic with bars and restraints up there as well. What an experience has to be done but 3 days is enough as its not really a holiday destination more a short city Break. Fantastic Food City wide.",50,1
127,"This hotel was there in the bucket list for its pool and the location. It is in an amazing location in Singapore and has the best views on either side of the hotel. The place is a freak for shopping, things to do and whatever else you could think of in Singapore. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is the highlight of the hotel. It is without doubt the pool with the best view in the world! The hotel is obviously expensive but it is every bit worth it. Th rooms are huge and comfortable.",50,1
128,"We booked and paid for accommodation for 2 adults & 3 children. Upon arrival we were told the rooms could only take maximum of 4 people. They offered us a 2nd room, with one room in Tower 1 and the other in Tower 3, we objected of course, so we eventually got two rooms & on the same floor but at opposite ends of the Tower. We were then charged $110 for a trundle bed because both rooms were only doubles. So my husband & one child stayed in one room & myself & two kids in the other. Very disappointing to say the least for the money we paid to stay here - another let down was the rooftop pool which was not cool & refreshing at all it was hot like a bath & the kids didn’t want to swim in it anymore after one swim only. Money better spent elsewhere I think - we won’t be back...",50,0
129,"This Hotel is honestly amazing, the rooms are spacious, beds extremely comfy and bathrooms lovely. The location is also great with both the MBS light show and the Garden light show close by. If you get a garden view you can see the trees at night - view was amazing, we was on floor 37. Staff were helpfull and allowed us to check in at 12.00. Fantastic experience.A little pricey considering you do not get breakfast and cant use facilities after the check out but thats the only downside everything else is perfect, especially the views.Located close to mrt - must use this! Amazing and so easy to get around.",20,1
130,"This hotel had been on our radar for years, so we had to stay at least one night when we finally made it to Singapore, although it was the most expensive hotel we have ever stayed at.The room and bathroom were big, good amenities, and comfortable bed. Great view of the marina. Impressive architecture. Staff were very professional and provided excellent, attentive service.Th infinity pool was crowded, but the views were worth it. There was an adults only section of the pool which we appreciated. In addition to the pool, there are also hot tubs on the opposite side. The observation deck also had great views.Overall worth the hype, one off the bucket list, but definitely an exceptional splurge.",40,1
131,All the surroundings just superb whether you are there during the day or night. So much to see and do. Easy to get to by public transports or to walk there if you stay in hotels along Singapore River.   Is a must visit if you are in Singapore.,50,1
132,I recommend every visit to Singapore must go to sky bar ... it’s $20 per pax but you get that back in return for your drink tab ... the views are magnificent and definitely have a Singapore sling  also the sky flyer wheel is well worth it ,50,1
133,"The hotel itself is huge, comfortable, spacious, architecturally superb. The pool is amazing, nothing else like it anywhere else. Unfortunately check in took 30 minutes. The staff seem to have far too much documentation to do, with rigid protocols. You would expect a booking done by the same person at the same time for 2 rooms would automatically ensure both rooms were in the same tower, but no. This seemed to be a problem, and the poor girl & her supervisor struggled for ages to make this happen. Thankfully they did, and after that the stay was great.",50,1
134,"Dear Lynden D, Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We regret to learn about the challenges you encountered during your check-in.  I would like to take this opportunity to share that due to our high occupancy, room allocations are subject to availability at the time of check-in. The times at which guests check-out pose a challenge for our team when looking to accommodate requests for rooms to be in the same tower or on the same floor.  I am glad that our team was able to find you two rooms in the same tower and I am happy to hear that you enjoyed the rest of your stay with us.  Thank you for your patience as we continue to review ways to improve the check-in experience for our guests. ",30,1
135,We stayed at the hotel for the infinity pool which was amazing. Though it was always crowded that made it uncomfortable. Staff had great service. Buffet food was extremely delicious. Shopping centre within the same complex was convenient and had a lot to offer. I will stay again but would be great if the pool wasn't as crowded.,50,1
136,We stopped here for one night (7th October 2018) and we wished we had booked another night! The room was lovely - so big and spacious and we had a city view.  We were on floor 27 so the views were excellent.  The shower room was also very big.  Facilities were good - the mini bar had a good selection of spirits/beer.  Dressing gowns and slippers were provided and there were also tea/coffee making facilities.  We used the infinity pool which was rather crowded but we got some really good photos during the day and at night when it was empty.  We stopped in the Ce La Vie Bar for a good few hours - drinks were not cheap but the views of Singapore at night were worth paying the bar prices! I would definitely stay here again if I visit Singapore in the future.,40,1
137,"Absolutely World Class was an absolute bargain approx £100 each from just after mid day to 6pm, continual flowing champagne, - not the cheap stuff mind... The food was amazing, the view was too good to be true, and the service was definitely 5 star. We were not staying at the hotel but had a day pass, was fantastic!!! you have to go there to appreciate the view of the city...",50,1
138,"Excellent hotel, the experience when you reach your hotel room and the view to Beautiful Singapore w/ special touch of Marina Bay Sands is unique! Excellent very spacious rooms, beautiful decor, amenities and the overall experience of The many activities at Marina Bay Sands is priceless! The scent around Marina Bay Sands is so fresh, the customer service is above and beyond - it is AN Experience!! The Infinity Pool, Jacuzzi on top floor is very unique!  A must visit and you can only access it if you are a hotel guest!",50,1
139,"Where to start. What a let down Marina Bay Sands is! It’s a huge corporate hotel which frankly hasn’t been updated since it opened & was the biggest let down of our trip. Service standards not great Room wasn’t ready on arrival (despite arriving after check in time)Internal decor very worn in bars & restaurants Pool area a complete let down - over crowed. Crap (and expensive) drinks Breakfast was ok, maybe we expected more Overall thoughts. Wish we’d stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Return visit. NEVER!",50,0
140,"Hi guys, So I would like to review my stay at Marina Bay Sands.**Firstly, The check-in and Check-out-If u have small kids or old age- they will directly take you to the vip counter for the same.Try your luck by asking them for a free upgrade and most likely you are to get one.Also, higher the floor better the view, so do insist on allocating a room on the higher floor (in ur selected category of room)The suite rooms have Gardens by the bay view from the washroom andCity view from the living and the bedroom.They have 3 tower bldgs.-Does not really make a difference as to where you are allocated, but my preference would go to Tower-3.**Room view ::  Please refer the hotel website for clear understanding of each room type and view.In short,Gardens by the Bay view -  Look at the gardens by day -ordinary and at nite- the gardens are lit up but u would eventually be going there to see. So i’d Likely give it a skipHarbour view- looking at the ships and harbour all the time long don’t fancy me much.City view - During the day the city skyline wakes u up with a high and the night will send u awestruck.It’s the City view+ River view + Merlion view.U can also see the water and light show from ur room that happens at 8pm-9pm-10pm on weekends.I would advice straight opt for a CITY VIEW hands down.** Infinity Pool-The iconic infinity pool has no words to describe.It’s the best I have seen till date. We were completely mind blown. Best pictures u can take under the basking sun and get in at around sunset to late evening time to see the flamboyant city gearing up.(Follow @jurvashi on Instagram to have a look)—-NOT TO BE MISSED - being in love with the infinity pool should not make u miss the 2 smallHOTTT JACUZZI POOLS located behind.Additional small section shallow section for kids too at one end.**Food and service-Food as heard is top notch and service is impeccable.But, if u are vegetarian there’s a problem,U would have hardly any options.You can’t even have French fries coz they use the same deep fryer where both non-veg and veg are fried.Thanks to the service staff courteous enough to inform about it in detail.The only options u would opt is sandwiches and salads. The most famous Singapore Sling a must try too.**Sight seeing-Gardens by the bay is just a 9mins walk.The casino and the high end Shoppes Mall is just attached where u can splurge on the best available fashion and show your worth.A  7/11 store is located within the Shoppes mall(in case u need to stock up on something or they even have options to micro and eat frozen meals.Pocket friendly and saving time to travel to the city and back.The Helix Bridge again is a 6min walk further extending to the MERLION area a total of 22mins. Right under the hotel is the - “BAYFRONT MRT STATION” in case u need to travel someplace else and back.I am definitely coming back in here..",50,1
141,Our 2nd visit and I have figured out that this great hotel has managed the impossible - quality AND quantity. It is a great destination in itself with so much to do and with really helpful staff. It is a massive hotel but you don’t feel like you’re just a number. The sheer number of quality cafes and restaurants and the pool at the top just polishes it off nicely. Definitely looking forward to visit number 3.,40,1
142,Not sure if it’s a hotel or an attraction? You can tell it was built and design by a Vegas hotel group!Rooms are of good size and beds are comfortable.The pool is huge with amazing views but there are a lot of people so trying to get a sun bed can be a bit difficult- and this was on an overcast day!  Another one ticked off the bucket list! ,50,1
143,"We stayed here as a family of three in September. The hotel was in a great location with direct access to both Gardens by the Bay and the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.The check in was very smooth and we were quickly checked in as soon as we arrived around 11:00am.The staff were very pleasant and helpful.Our room was located on floor 11 facing the marina which offered a great view, especially with the floor to ceiling window. The rooms were spacious and modern, offering everything needed.The pool is definitely the main attraction here, with was fantastic. The view was great and plenty of sun loungers, as only residents have access to this area, which is highly monitored by staff. Also with an adults area only. There is also plenty of places to eat and drink on the rooftop also.Again offering a fantastic view of garden by the bay and the marina.I would highly recommend staying here if you can.",50,1
144,"It is an iconic hotel with amazing views from the very very crowed pool, it is fine but in my opinion is not worth the price.The best thing at the room was the view to the gardens, we were at the 55th floor, so that  view was amazing.Had few pricey cocktails at the rooftop (around 26 plus taxes), at least they were decent. The service not so much.I mean the room was ok, ours was with a connecting door so you could hear the neighbours. The bed comfortable and all... but nothing was worth the price, nothing special but the view. It feels like a casino hotel... wait of course it is a casino hotel.We payed around 400 usd per night and didn't include breakfast... ;(",50,1
145,"I originally wanted to go to MBS because of that infinity pool and I was willing to pay over $500AUD for the one night! Seriously seriously worth it... the views of Singapore that I got, the comfort of the hotel rooms themselves and of course that pool! I can’t wait to go again and hopefully this time be able to split the room rate with someone else. The staff were all so lovely, helpful and attentitive. You get access to the Sands Sky Deck and you can go at anytime from your room to level 57 anytime. I got lucky with an east facing balcony so I got a view of the Gardens by the Bay and the sunrise! Thanks Sands for an awesome time. ***one verry happy customer***",30,1
146,"My wife and I stopped here for a pre cruise stay. We decided at last minute to switch from a traditional hotel to this one as it is truly iconic symbol of SingaporeThe hotel has a bit of a “Vegas” feel about it. It is a huge sprawling resort in itself. However our room was extremely well equipped with a great view of Gardens by the Bay and the water. We visited the rooftop pool and restaurant, as well as the light showOverall thoroughly worthwhile and feels like we’ve stopped now in probably 1 of the top 5 hotel icons in the world",50,1
147,"As touristic as beautiful place to see.Skyline is amazing and the light show too, every night at 7 and 8pm.Don't miss the chance to have a cocktail on the wonderful bars placed at 57th floor, you will never forget it!",50,1
148,Great place to stay. very friendly staff and nothing was too much. even relocation to an other room as initially booked was no problem at all. Coming in the room the luggage was already in the room while check - in took only about 5 minutes. The room itself was very spacious with a sitting area and amazing view over the city. all amenities were present . Nothing you could wish for that was not present. Furnitire was very new and clean as also the carpet. And for the first time in any hotel enough wall outlets to charge telephones and laptop.Swimming pool at the top was impressive. Point of attention: breakfast at the top does not give you a view. We had a great stay and will be back,40,1
149,"Marina Bay sands is the crowning jewel of Singapore. The hotel is luxurious and the casino is professionally managed. The roof top swimming pool , bar and the restaurants are classy. Must visit when in Singapore!!",50,1
150,"Recently my wife, myself, my brother in law and his wife had a two-night stay at Marina Bay Sands at what was the culmination of a trip-of-a-lifetime for us. We picked Marina Bay Sands because of the perceived prestige and 5-star service we could expect there. Sadly we were mistaken.As indicated, our stay was from 30/11/2018 until 01/11/2018. The booking numbers were MB15AB4DCA94 and MBB8F5256721. I should have read the warning signs when I noticed your website says the cheapest price on the internet, but that is BEFORE you add taxes and service charges. I find this practice to be outright deceiving. But still, we wanted to stay at the world famous ""Marina Bay Sands"".On our arrival were made to wait 45 minutes to be served at the check-in counter, after travelling for the previous 10 hours. The crowd didn't seem that big but each check-in seemed to take an inordinate amount of time. Either the staff are inept or the systems are poor. It doesn't really matter to a paying customer, all I know is it was very frustrating. Whilst waiting I decided to check on why the people from LAVO restaurant had refused to answer my many booking emails over the previous few months. So I went over to their booth whilst the rest of our party waited to be served at reception. They gave no reason and told us that LAVO restaurant was not open for the public tonight. I thought this most strange but (stupidly) asked for a booking for the following evening. It was made for 7:45 but I was curtly told that the booking would only be held for 15 minutes so don't be late. I was also told about the dress rules whilst the hostess looked down her nose at the way I was attired. I really didn't take too kindly to this but as most Australians do, I just ""took it on board"". When we finally got served at reception, we were then told we couldn't have the rooms we booked, Premier Rooms - Premier King Garden View (your description). Your staff wanted to give us a double room with a city view, and tried to tell us this was an upgrade? After much arguing and insistence, it was agreed that we could, after all, have rooms with a garden view and king beds but they would be on separate floors (22 & 39). The room on the 22nd floor was, in fact, inferior and smaller to what we had booked. No compensation was offered for this downgrade.When we got to our rooms we waiting about 15 minutes for our bags to arrive. Unfortunately, the wrong bags were brought to our room and we had to wait another half an hour for your baggage people to work our where our bags were and bring them to our room. Again, only trite apologies were made and no explanation or compensation offered.We then decided to have a pre-dinner drink up on the Sky Park, Ce La Vie bar. We ordered 2 glasses of bubbly wine and two beers. We had become accustomed to paying slightly higher charges on our trip but $132 for this order is both unjustifiable and in most other civilised countries would be considered criminal. Obviously, from then on we drank and dined outside of Marina Bay Sands. This included cancelling out booking at LAVO for fear that we would once again ""be taken for a ride"" with the pricing policy.After enjoying other attractions and eateries around Singapore we booked our transfer to the airport with the concierge on the night before we were to leave at 7:45AM on 01/11/2018. This included having our bags picked up at our rooms at 07:30AM. No one arrived (as well expected) to pick up bags so we took them downstairs ourselves and waited for our ride. Our transfer had not arrived by 08:00AM and after discussing this with the concierge staff we ended up just hailing a cab that was dropping off other people at the hotel. I asked the concierge to follow up why this happened and to contact me by email. No one has bothered to do that as yet.So, I am intrigued at how (if at all) you will be able to regain my trust and custom to once again stay again at Marina Bay Sands when we travel through Singapore next January.",50,0
151,What a gorgeous and unique hotel located in the beautiful Marina Bay area of Singapore...my husband and I booked a club room for one night to kick off our 1yr anniversary vacation and it was SO worth it! From the separate club lounge check-in area to the food...overall service...rooftop bar & infinity pool...spectra light show...etc. etc. it was amazing! I felt like I had stars in my eyes from the sheer beauty of everything we experienced at this hotel. Would HIGHLY recommend and absolutely want to return!!,10,1
152,"We only got to spend 1 night here, but would do it all over again. Beautiful hotel, stunning view from our room, gorgeous bathroom, roof top pool amazing. love love love this hotel... Room service was, impeccable also, a first class hotel that everyone must experience.  Next time I will be staying longer....",50,1
153,"A very well know hotel, with the infinite ruff top pool.Much more beyond this. It’s huge, and all the spaces are occupied with incredible piece of art. There is a wall cover by a steel mash that moves with the wind.Restaurants as you like, a mall with all shops that one might wanna visit.The rooms are quite regular, but if you stay above 20 floor with a city view that can cause some impact.The service is what one expect from a hotel like this.The roof top. You gonna have your breakfast there, and is a very good breakfast. Lots of options, again, from any part of the world. Luxuriously served.The night club is in this floor to! And the famous pool. I confess that impressed me much more from outside that from inside. But it’s incredible anyway. A little crowd.",50,1
154,"It started with a 45-minute wait to be served to check in then it just got worse and worse. Screwed up our booking and could not put us on the same floor as the couple we were travelling with. Then could not offer our friends a garden view room and tried to pass off the lower grade city view as a ""free upgrade"". Eventually after much arguing both couples have garden view rooms with us on the 39th floor and the other couple in a smaller room on the 22nd floor. No offer of refund or compensation. Then the problems started! They managed to balls up all our bags and sent our bags to the other couples room and vice versa. That took another hour or so to sort out and when I complained about the service they would not reply to me and only changed the subject.We decided to meet upstairs and have a drink at a bar up on the Skydeck. Yes, this is (an alleged) 5-star hotel and we did expect higher than normal prices what following was just gobsmacking. $132 for two bubbly wines and two beers!!! You've got to kidding!!We also wanted to book into the Italian restaurant that evening but that was closed for a private function. This must have been the reason they refused to acknowledge or return any of my emails I had sent to book this place months prior to our arrival.So we decided to just do our own thing ate out away from this ""joint"" at Newton's Circus and Satay Street over the next couple of nights and also taking in Gardens by the Bay and the two magnificent conservatoriums.Stupidly we used the hotel's concierge to book our transfer back to the airport which included having our luggage picked up from our rooms 15 mins before. no one turned up to collect our bags so we took them downstairs ourselves to meet our transfer. Guess what? The transfer failed to arrive!! Ended up just grabbing a cab that was dropping someone else off.We paid $500 a night for a once in a lifetime 5-star experience and all we got was appalling service. BUT MOST ANNOYING AND INSULTING WAS THE COMPLETE LACK OF CARE OR EMPATHY ANYONE SHOWED ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS.Our advice - look somewhere else - don't bother.P.S. - Still waiting for someone to reply to my email detailing our experience.",40,0

156,"You should stay at least a  night to use all facilities and experience the giant superb service. So organised and perfect, everything is perfect. Yes, a lot of people around the pool (and we all there for the same reason ;) )  , but all worth it! Plenty of places to eat, and great if you watch a video on youtube how this hotel was build, how restaurants function with the help of most famous chefs. Didnt take breakfast as used a coffee shop 'Sweetspot' which is great and has everything you may want, plus delicious desserts. Pool can use with cards of the room and kids area is separate from adults. Can be chilly on a cloudy day as I dont think its heated..  Use some of the bars around the pool for a lovely experience. We had a room over 30th floor overlooking the Gardens, so we could even watch shows from our balcony. JUST STAY ONCE! its all worth it :)",40,1
157,"One of the most exceptional resorts we’ve ever visited worldwide. Our stay at the Marina Bay Executive Suite was full of luxury, comfort and upper class facilities.No need to say that the views from the both sides of the suite were just stunning. Unique Singapore skyline view from our bedroom and living room; Uninterrupted harbour and ocean view from our floor to ceilings windows in the bathroom.If you choose a club room or a suite, then the access to Club55 Bar-Restaurant will transform this place to your everyday afternoon addiction.Canapés & Champagne at their best...",50,1
158,"Definitely loved this hotel very super high service and standard how to deal with the guest, the hotel is really spectacular we got a super club room in the tower 2 and view with the city floor 40 that’s all, our check-in very high style and very friendly too that is the more important.With the infinity pool upstairs access and few free drinks from 5pm to 7pm was the perfect hotel for enjoy high quality with view and nice atmosphere. Will definitely come back to Singapore just for stay in the hotel. ",50,1
159,"Marina Bay Sands, Singapore needs no Introduction for it awe inspiring architecture.I have had a stay at this place last year when I visited Singapore. We got our room on the 20th floor and I must say I was amazed with the view of the room. The rooms is neatly designed with twin bed and comfort cushion. All the amenities of the room were available as promised on the website. Room service was excellent, security for the guest is impressive.There is an inifinity pool on the 57th floor of the Hotel which gives beautiful panaromic view of the city.I would be looking forward for a stay here again when I am in Singapore in the future.",50,1
160,"A Luxury hotel with infinity pool. My advise is to go to the infinity pool earlier to avoid the peak hour to enjoy the view, it can be really crowded during peak hour. Not a pool to swim but a pool to see Singapore's skyline.",50,1
161,I had a great experience at Marina Bay Sands. The room where I stayed was admirably clean and the staff were kind and helpful. I loved the breakfast buffet with varieties of food. The infinity pool was extraordinarily superb. The Marina Bay Sands is a place where you have to stay at if you love traveling with quality facilities with great hospitality. Thanks to Marina Bay Sands management and the staff.,50,1
162,"This is a beautiful place. It’s near natural garden, so relax and take a good photo. Room’s very clean and so amazing but bath room is very basic.Room service was expensive but quite good. The swimming pool is simply amazing. It’ very comfortable to travel another place because it’s near Restaurant, Department-store, Art Science Museum, Bar & Club.",50,1
163,the most excellent place in singapore. a place where I can truly get the service. Hotel work at a higher level. The view from the swimming pool is simply amazing. The price for the level of this hotel is low. especially pleased with the most delicious dinner from the chef!,30,1
164,Booked a room for my birthday celebration.  We had a really nice view by the garden.  Very romantic!  Service is excellent.  We didn’t have to go anywhere because shops are already within the hotel.  Highly recommendable!,50,1
165,"We loved staying here! We splurged for our 5-year anniversary since we are usually budget travellers. You must wake up early to take good pictures. We woke up around 6:30 am and took great pictures with good lighting and without many people! We had room service which was expensive but quite good. We just split 1 breakfast and it was enough for 2 people. You come here for the infinity pool and to take good pictures, so enjoy!",50,1
166,"From the checkin to the service provided at every turn this is top shelf experience.  Our room was amazing and everything in it exceeded our expectations. I sometimes felt like we were the only guests with the attention we received. The views of Singapore are unparalleled. The pool is even better than advertised and the food was amazing. The breakfast buffet at Rise had me anticipating waking up to eat each day. I would definitely stay here again. While the costs are not cheap, it is worth it.",50,1
167,"Fantastic panoramic views of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay and Supertree Grove, etc.from observation deck on 57th floor. Infinity Pool, world's largest rooftop infinity pool same deck. Also super views from our balcony on 45th floor.Best view in Singapore of ""Supertrees"" - supersized man-made trees 75 to 150 ft high.Excellent service, food, room service food, etc,(should be, hotel expensive, but first class and worth a visit).Many bars and restaurants of all ethnicities, loved Spago and Ce La Vi on the observation deck the best.Disappointing, business center not in hotel, but in convention center adjacent.",50,1
168,"We had a wonderful 4 day stay here. Our room was amazing, spacious, comfortable with balcony views of the beautiful Gardens by the Bay. The light show was fantastic at night. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was a must see and can get crowded.. I got up early one day to see the sun rise and others had the same idea but still quiet at that time of the morning.. Amazing to be swimming so high above with the skyscrapers around you.. Food and drinks at the restaurants and room service are pricey.",50,1
169,"The hotel met all our expectations. All the staff worked tirelessly as a team to ensure we were looked after during our stay. Our room was a Club City View located on the 49th floor, and it was awesome. The benefits of your Club55 package really enhanced our experience. The infinity pool was amazing, and the catering exquisite. Lots of photo's from outside also to remember it all by. Thank you MBS.",50,1
170,"My hubby and I are generally pretty budget travellers, but the one place we wanted to stay on our recent Singapore/Thailand holiday was Marina Bay Sands. We do not regret the decision! Yes, it's super expensive, but it's totally worth it to be able to swim in the world's most incredible infinity pool. If you aren't a guest, you can't use it. We were here 2 nights...the place is huge and glamorous. We found the staff really lovely, the room was great (lovely view of Gardens by the Bay too) and seriously I still cannot get over the pool! We had the best time!",50,1
171,"That’s just it. I probably would never be able to afford to stay here. I had the privilege of staying in the hotel thanks to a friend who was attending a trade fair. Her room had two double beds and had the fantastic view of the Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline.Immense. Imposing. Incredible. The sails of the Marina Bay Sands is indeed a sight to behold. The infinity pool at the Skypark and the Ce La Vie discotheque, ‘featured’ in the film, Crazy Rich Asians were among those that I sought to check out.No breakfast was taken in the hotel - in my case - despite the array of restaurants featuring celebrity chefs. I carefully guarded my purse and stayed stuck to an already very tight budget.Location is ideal to see the best of what Singapore has to offer for the first time visitor. Gardens by the Bay. Art Science Museum. Design Museum. Fullerton Place. Musicals at The Theatre in Marina Bay Sands. The MRT station is within the Marina Bay Sands Exhibition and Convention Centre so every other destination is just a short hop away via the MRT.I barely had any interaction with the hotel staff but for those that I interacted with, they were professional and courteous. It must be a mean feat to run a tight ship like Marina Bay Sands. Oh, people will talk about the infinity pool. It’s pretty shallow so hard to do any proper laps. Divided into two - one part welcomes kids. Another part is for adults only. I tried to do laps in the adult pool to keep warm as the water was icy cold. Beware though - you’d feel like an intruder doing laps as most are only in the pool for a photo op :0).The sauna and the warm pools were a welcome respite after some time I. The Skypark pool.Overall - great place to stay if you can splurge. Otherwise, this is just a novelty you can save for once-in-a-lifetime.",50,1
172,"We got room at Tower 3. facing Merlion statue and city view surrounding. Room quite standard, furniture, bed ,lamps lighting not belong to luxury one.  Bath room very basic. quite disappoint it doesn`t have shower handle. After all is clean and proper. Going up to the pool all the way long you have to que up n waiting the elevator. crowded with people going up and down. ",50,1
173,"it was my first time staying at here. I decided to stay here for my birthday so I thought I’d spend a little more than I usually do on hotel rooms. The hotel was beautiful and thought it was put together perfectly. I love their restaurant/bar collection, definitely a world class dining experience. If you decide to stay here expect to pay a little more for an elevated service.",30,1
174,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for my husbands birthday and my husband was bullied and harassed by the life guard because he was wearing a t-shirt in the pool the problem was there where multiple people wearing t-shirts in the pool but he was the only one dragged out as he was not there race. I called the manager and they done nothing about it. They came to our room as we were checking out to bring a cake for my husbands birthday little to late. I would never recommend this hotel  to anyone considering how much it cost and for the terrible service and the way my husband was treated. They absolutely ruined my husbands birthday.,50,0
175,"I was Stayed in MBS during ITB Asia and truly saying it is really worth it to stayed in Marina bay sand hotel. Check in, House keeping, Room amenities, pool, Lavo restaurant and all other services was excellent.",50,1

She even help me to get the smoking room which i paid extra charge on this. The room, was spacious and along the corridor of the floor, the ambiance smells good! Mr Sien Le, the housekeeping staff who keeps our rooms tidy, he was very very helpful and courteous. I definitely appraise of his job well done. The Sky deck at 57 had the best view of Garden by the Bay and the pool was amazing!",50,1
177,"Everything was as expected. Nice shopping, a trip down the casino just for fun.Didn’t manage to swim though due to the crowd. Great view. Would recommend if u love a lively environment. For those who prefer a more private environment, would not recommend. ",50,1
178,Went for a family staycation. Superb location to gardens by the bay (5-8mins walk away). My hotel room faced the other side away from gardens by the bay but I get to see river views and city skyscrapers. Easily accessible to other places via underground MRT transport system. The room was spacious and equipped with amenities. Loved the views from our hotel room. Affordable food options I recommend food court at the Shoppes to try local delicacy. Must visit nearest attraction would definitely be gardens by the bay- flower dome and cloud forest.  ,40,1
179,"Well worth a stay just to experience *that* pool. The hotel itself is comfortably 4 star but the pool would be 6. Yes it is crowded and can be a 'soup' full of those with selfie sticks but the sensation and views are just mindblowing especially late in the evening (open to 11). The rooftop bar within the hotel is similarly stunning at night.The rooms are average though the gym is well equipped and spacious.The connection of lifts is confusing at first.Last and definitely least, a queue of up to 20 minutes every day for breakfast is just not acceptable at this level; particularly given the adjacent conference centre and need for delegates to eat and go quickly.",50,1
180,"Marina Bay Sands is first of all an architecture wonder, a place representing the triumph of the mankind as building such a hugh hotel, business and tourism complex is definetely something extraordinary. With the shape of a giant ship, the complex has three towers and an enormous deck linking them all and hosting a 150 m long pool, restaurants and more. The views from the pool and generally from the deck are amazing. Rooms are spacious and offer themselves as well beautifull views (we had the views over Gardens by the Bay and the ocean) but they are not amazing design wise. Restaurants in the complex are numerous and of a high quality as regards the dinner and good as regards breakfast. Service was excellent everywhere but I trust it is as it should be considering the price. The hotel is interconnected with a hugh mall displaying only top end trademarks, with the hotel's theaters and casinos (both of amazingly big surface), subway and the beautiful Gardens by the Bay. A place not to be missed if you go to Singapore.",40,1
181,"This is my second visit to this Hotel in 2 years. I just keeps getting better. The hotel itself is ""off the charts"", the views are stunning, and the staff super friendly and efficient. The hotel offers all amenities and of course the rim-flow sky pool 57 stories up. This time round we stayed in a room with the City view.",50,1
182,"How do I put this! After spending a gorgeous 3 hours in the pool we had paid over $650 a night per room for, our friend who we had been travelling with was rudely pointed out by the lifeguard at the pool in front of EVERYONE! You, You, come here show me your t'shirt! Our friend who had surgery on his arm and had a massive scar and who wasn't confident with his body shape to go without it a T’shirt. The lifeguard yells out no cotton allowed in the pool you take it off or get out! Our friend advised him in a soft tone that he wasn't confident without it so he got yelled at and told that he needed to get out! Mind you, at the same time about a handful of other people with cotton tops and skirts had been in the pool and none of them got pulled out! What makes this worse is I pointed out the other people and he yelled at me at the side of the pool for it! Then it gets worse! He pulls me over to the gift shop and shows me a size small top for my friend and goes he can buy this and he can go in the pool! Ummm dude, how dare you insult a larger person by showing them a size small top! We are talking about a man that’s over 2 meters tall here!I asked him if it stated that no cotton was allowed in the pool and the rules of entering don’t state anything just that proper pool attire is required! That to me means that you need to be respectful and wear proper attire and not go naked!No cotton isn’t listed on the rules of entering so how can you do that to someone. To make it worse as soon as he heard that we had been speaking to management he left and never apologized for his behaviour. He made someone feel like absolute garbage and embarrassed them and the hotel then argued with us! We paid this place $1250 for 2 rooms! They ruined our birthdays and then expected to give us $100.00 to soften the deal! Ummmm NO! How dare they be allowed to be ruin someone’s stay like that and then be rude on the phone! Not once did they apologies for his behaviour and said that they would make an exception for our friend! An exception that should have never be needed because their rules aren’t clear! The lifeguard continued his shift while another 20 odd people entered the pool with cotton tops and didn’t tell anyone else off! How dare they be allowed to shame someone and make them feel bad about themselves! You don’t know what people have been through or are going through! Also, why are the lifeguards wearing cotton tops if they aren’t allowed in the pool? Is the lifeguard expected to take his t’shirt off before they jump in to save someone? Funny that the other lifeguard laughed when I asked him why he was wearing a cotton t’shirt if it’s not allowed in the pool!Talk about double standards!",50,1
183,"I didn't know what to expect and thought that it would be all hype but it was quite impressive. It may not be for the business traveler, in terms of value, but romance, family, or solo may be well worth the cost. It is an adventure in that it is so unique and captures one's imagination completely. It is sort of surreal.",10,1
184,"We stayed just one night, fresh in from a very early flight. The staff were friendly and spoke good english.  We tried our luck for an early check in, but room wasn't ready.  That was ok to be expected with such a busy hotel.  We were able to put our luggage into storage and take a look around.  We were told room would be ready by check-in time at 3pm.  But they would email us if it was earlier.  Which they did, we got into our room by 1pm, which we were so grateful for.The most famous infinity pool will blow you away, the main reason to stay here.  Add it to your bucket list, you will not be disappointed. The gardens by the bay, night lights show, was amazing to be able to watch from our balcony. Just for that, the stay was worth every cent.",50,1
185,"Amazing, beautiful, comfortable for business needs and unbelievable service !! Can't wait to come back.        The personal assistance made the business more comfortable and professional. No doubt will come back",50,1
186,"First thing- ghe taxi from airport to hotel vost about 15-20 Singapore dollars and it is about 15-20 minutes away.The hotel is magnifisent! The huge beautiful building seeing from far away.The check in going satisfactory fast. We made reservation for premium room and at check in you leave 400 Singapore dollars deposit which can be used for food and drink at hotel or if you don’t sprend it they are returning it at check out.Our room was great No.3392 We had beautiful front view at the city and great view at the sea and garden from bathroom.Everything comfortable clean perfect!Our cleaning lady - Hua Li made our room every day more and more beautiful.The pool at the top- Infinity pool is really something unique!The hotel has a couple nice restaurants and it is conected to big shoping mall, Congress centar, Casino and metro station.Everyone at the hotel nice and polite!The best hotel I have ever been!",50,1
187,"Club room definitely worth paying extra - calm breakfast, canapes and drinks at daytime and champagne in the evening. Weekends are usually very busy so make sure you have your breakfast early to avoid queues. Hotel staff is super friendly and nice! definitely will stay here again!",50,1
188,"We had a basic room on a lower floor, but it was very nice. The staff were super helpful at everything and room service was quick and efficient. The infinity pool! This was awesome. it was packed but we soon found a great bunch of pooside seats for ourselves and our friends. The poolside service was great too. Drinks and food quick and aplenty. I'll also review ADRIFT (lobby bar and restaurant) this place is awesome! The service there was so good. The staff were so nice and made sure we had a great time. The cocktails were INCREDIBLE. Did i mention i loved the staff? Also, we had a few events to attend during the night and the hotel put us in contact with a sitter service that guests often used. - the service is not part of the hotel -We were happy with their recommendation, the sitter was so lovely and we were very happy with her. Our little person was also very happy! Check out was easy, and we opted to pay a little more for a late check out. The hotel is very busy but there's lots to do at the mall/casino etc attached so you barely notice the crowds.The mall is great and if you are saving for a few big meals, there's a great food court there too to save a few bucks.",50,1
189,"My experience was super pleasant as I was well looked after by a Worker name Joseph Lee Teck Shan. I bought some wooden chimes and advised what other benefits the hotel offers so I can get a good experience. He was very patient with me whilst helping me all the way to the roof top where the scenary with great view of Singapore. Thanks Joseph for your wonderful puzzle gift for our honeymoom.Regards,Khang LeSydney Australia",40,1
190,"We stayed one night here before our long flight back to Canada. We stayed on the 61st floor in a King Garden View Suite. The view was Stunning. You have a view of the ocean, Gardens by the Bay, etc. The pool and its ICONIC view overlooking Singapore is breathtaking. Be sure to go early in the morning so you can get a pool side chair as these are a hot commodity! Have a glass or rose and soak up that view! Spago, the restaurant, is a MUST! We had a superb dinning experience. We also tried Lavo which was a total disappointment. The service was AWFUL. we got ignored by our server for 15 minutes after we sat down and he never checked in once we go our meal. The view from Lavo is beautiful but it is completely overhyped. I wish we had booked a second meal at Spago over Lavo. Spago has just as good a view and the service and care was top-tier. This is a luxury hotel, but the views from the rooms and pool are worth every penny!",50,1
191,Hi we spent two nights in MBS and what two days they were. staff were helpful although it was a long process to check in . Our room was stunning we was on 47 th floor with a city view. World class restaurants and the swimming pool out of this world . Worth visiting gardens by the bay . Well what can we say  EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT ,50,1
192,"As a remarkable landmark of Singapore, I recommend this hotel. As you know, it is known for its great infinity pool and definitely it is wonderful. And also the staffs are kind and professional. There are several Korean staffs and they are ready to help you. That is why I tried this hotel twice - first was 2016 and this time. A room condition was okay and met my expectation. * 수영장 하나만으로도 값어치 한다고 생각합니다. 인피니티 풀에서 보는 뷰는 낮/밤 모두 환상적이니 꼭 챙겨보세요 :) ",50,1
193,"Among a few other attractions to visit Singapore – a stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was a dream too.We thought we could write raving review about that iconic building and our memorable stay in the lap of luxury.  It turned out to be a bad dream that one never want to experience a second time.To start with we do not consider this hotel as a luxury offering, not even up to 5 star standards of other hotels in Singapore or elsewhere. The level of communicative English of customer service employees was very poor.  The amenities provided as toiletries etc. were of cheap quality, the shower (instead of a rain shower) was a low pressure mist spray rather than shower. There was not even a hand shower. When we complained the reception seems to be ignorant what A RAIN SHOWER OR A HAND SHOWER IS. To our utter surprise they sent us plastic water buckets (which apparently is their common solution to this complaint). Please see the photos. When we asked for room with proper shower or bath tub they offered to shift us to handicapped room or bring a child plastic bath tub.  It is lack of professionalism that the Hotel Management did not realise (if they have then did not communicate with the guests) the noise and disturbance that could be caused by the Singapore Ladies Run around 5:00 am on 13th of October at the Gardens by the Bay. When we complained about the high decibel noise on our 44th floor, the reception offered to speak to the neighbors. They should have known the noise was from outside. The noise through loud speakers woke up many guests, each comically blaming the next room neighbor (we personally went to their door and disturbed them thinking they were causing the noise).  WHAT A PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT, AND AT A PRICE THAT IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN SINGAPORE.We requests guests planning to stay here to be aware. The only attraction really is the roof top swimming pool, period.Grossly disappointed.",40,1

The gardens are beautiful and light up at night for a magnificent light show.The glass house done, hides beautiful gardens inside..thus whole pkace us wonderful.You may need more than one day to see and experience it all. Use taxi or train tk get you there... as long as you are not a long way out of the city.Your tour desk will give you an approx price on the fares.",50,1
196,Had a night here with husband. Its great to able to swim on top of the hotel where you can able to watch all the surrounding of Marina bay. The hotel is massive and its really clean. Even though its quite expensive.,50,1
197,"I stayed one night at Marina Bay Sands with a previous memory of impeccable service and the high-quality facilities. The room is large and comfortable though a bit dusty and the terrace was quite dirty and messy with dried leaves and wilting flowers all over the floor. Nevertheless, I was tremendously impressed with the view of the room, depicting the majestic light of the Gardens by the Bay. Loved the experience of the Swimming Pool so much though quite crowded. However, I would like to give a big applause to one Life Guard who was super-friendly and offered great assistance (forgot to ask for his name but he is quite senior in terms of age, and he could speak Thai too. He said he worked in Chiang Mai before) He helped offer to take nice photos at the pool for me and had a warm, friendly conversation. This part was really one of the most memorable one during my stay. I would definitely come back to stay here. ",50,1
198,"My Trip to Singapore.... Awesome.I just experienced the best customer service ever. I stayed at different hotels local and international but, I will give my highest rating...i.e. 5 STARS to Marina Bay Sands and Singapore city",50,1
199,"Worst guest relation for a prestiges hotel.After our flight got canceled we went to front desk at tower one to request for an additional night, night shift attendant mansor said the hotel is at 101% occupancy for the 23rd of October we requested to speak to the duty manger “Ian” came out with one hand in pocket and being bery carless about our situation saying mansor said we are fully booked and nothing can be done all our 2561 rooms are booked. After mentioning that we are a group with 2 sky view rooms and an orchid suite booked for the last 4 nights you except we stay on the street since the flight is cancelled. The reply from a manger “Ian” at a hotel which is considered to be one of the best in singapore is not acceptable since he could have said we can wait till tomorrow to check if any cancelation will happen and we will get back to you.After stepping away from the front desk and checking the first app “booking.com” find many rooms and booked one to saved ourselves.Very inconsiderate and unprofessional staff at such a well known hotel.",50,1
200,"I just experienced the best customer service ever. I stayed at different hotels local and international but, I will give my highest rating in terms of customer service here at Marina Bay Sands. The one that really completed my stay is when I decided to have some drinks at Celavi Club Lounge. Mikko the waiter is very attentive in terms on what I need. He is extremly nice and even offered the best seat and view in the lounge. Very superb service. Kuddos Mikko and keep up the good work!",10,1
201,The Singapore Jewellery Fair was held in one of the Convention Halls in Marina Bay Sands and I was impressed by the spaciousness of the Halls. Toilets were also conveniently located within the Hall as well as just outside. Marina Bay Sands is huge and impressive.,50,1
202,"Good sized room, great views but average value overall considering the price. The service should be spot in but was hit and miss. Some staff certainly were polite and kind but there were some glaring errors that made the stay a little more unpleasant. Queuing to go for breakfast and waiting so long for the elevator was also a problem, too many rooms, not enough facilities to cater. On a more positive note, the restaurant service was good in general. Manager was friendly and smiley. The room/housekeeping service were fine and the city views from the swimming pool on top were breathtaking and made the trip memorable overall. The jacozzi overlooking the garden bay was also superb. Happy overall, but some points need to addressing to make this hotel truly value for money.",50,1
203,"My partner and I stayed here as a treat for my 30th. We originally booked for three nights (twin room by mistake) and added on an extra night which was a double room. When checked in receptionist asked if we would rather have the double room for the duration and changed it which was perfect for us. Rooms are gorgeous, so spacious and clean. We had a balcony overlooking the gardens by the bay which was stunning. I miss that view every day! I had cake for my birthday to return to each night and my bed turned down with slippers ready. We had our last day at the rooftop pool drinking cocktails all day, it wasn’t too busy and the service was excellent. Drinks so much cheaper than I expected too, we pay much more in the UK for cocktails of that standard. Spent an hour or so in CE LA VIE (rooftop bar) quite good fun and not pretentious in any way. LOVED it here! I miss it so much. ",30,1
204,"Huge cement block. Typical spot for tourists who like be packed sardine style. A Caribbean cruise is likely a same experience in my opinion. It is a signature of Singapore, yes. You have to visit it. perhaps yes. Would I stay there? Not even for free.",50,1
205,Have just come back from an impressive 4 night stay at the Marina Bay Sands. That hotel is pretty damn amazing!! We arrived at midnight after a long flight from NZ and found no queues waiting for us at Tower one. Got a nice wee room upgrade too. The room was really spacious. And was equipped with all the amenities you could ever want. Even mouthwash. The beds were a little firm though as previous reviewers have mentioned. We also really loved the towel sculptures left by our cleaner each day. Too cute to use!We just loved that pool deck and enjoyed cocktails one night at the Spago lounge and bar - delicious good there too. You are breakfast at the Sweet Spot - really good coffee when Wayne is doing Barrista duty. Delicious pastries and really nice / fresh tropical fruit cups. Much more affordable then the 53 dollar buffets in all the other MBS restaurants. The Bayfront MRT is really handy and the whole MRT system is easy to use. So clean too. Would definitely recommend this hotel - just such an amazing architectural hotel.,30,1
206,"This is the 3rd time we've stayed at Marina Bay Sands over the past 5 - 6 years. We've seen some subtle changes over this period. Drapes on our window, some furniture & chairs in the Club 55 Restaurant all a little tired looking & showing wear.We had a club room for 3 nights which has many benefits (particularly if you want to spoil yourself). Disappointingly the check-in process was not one of the benefits taking 30 - 45 minutes which is not pleasant after a 12hr flight.The chefs at Club 55 do a remarkable job with the variety & quality of food they produce. Amongst the standout staff I would mention Vinson whose good humour & cheerfulness was most welcoming. Then there is Mina, each time we have stayed, we have noticed her tireless work ethic - people like her are invaluable.This is our go-to place now after returning from long trips in Europe. Great rooms, excellent staff, superb housekeeping. They do push the ""booking on-line"" a little too much though - I don't need that.",50,1
207,Stunning Hotel top class service.We had an amazing stay at this hotel bars and restaurants were first class.The rooftop pool is a magical place overlooking the city we will definitely return ,40,1
208,The promenade is lovely around Marina Bay Sands. They have amazing lights show during this time of the year. It’s a great idea to take a walk in the evening. They even have fans everywhere along. As a matter of fact Singapore is amazing as a destination. It is a jewel of a country. Best shopping and food experience. It is exquisite place to visit. ,50,1
209,"Amazing pool, the view is amazing. The pool is too crowded and if you want to have a nice bed you have to go by the pool early in the morning. The rooms are okay. The restaurants by the pool have amazing food but a little bit expensive.",50,1
210,This is an iconic place to visit. The pool on the rooftop is great and is open until 11pm at night. We have done breakfast at Spago restaurant on the rooftop a few times and it is a great start to the day. Views are amazing. ,50,1
211,Stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon. Worked out about £800 in total with the £100 per night deposit they charge on top of the room rate. Not only this but we don’t get it back for at least a month which isn’t ideal when travelling around. Don’t get me wrong the rooms are nice very spacious etc but not near worth the money especially considering the check in is like a queue in a supermarket and the foyer is mad busy with people/kids everywhere. Also our check in was supposed to be 3pm but our room wasn’t ready until 5 which was very annoying considering we had flew from Ireland. We would have been even more raging if we had of been staying only one night which I’m sure people do because of cost.,50,1
212,We stayed here for our Honeymoon a few weeks ago and it was simply incredible.The staff were amazing from the first moment we arrived right until we left. They were so nice and friendly and just great at their jobs. The food was excellent and the rooms were just amazing. If anyone is considering staying here I'm sure you won't regret it as I wouldn't be able to criticize any aspect of the stay. Five stars all the way!!!An extra special thanks to Devi the front desk agent who we dealt with as she went above and beyond to get us an upgrade to an incredible room and really made the trip extra special......she deserves a promotion!!,30,1

215,"Realistically it’s all about the pool, but the pool is crowded and dingy. Why use brown tiles for a pool, it just makes it look dirty. Room was superb, but at that price it really should be. Eating was a problem, there are restaurants in the hotel but no menus on view so to avoid the embarrassment of going in and finding they didn’t suit us we stated away. There’s a little coffee shop in tower 3 for breakfast.We arrived by bus and walked across the bridge only to find we had to walk about 20 minutes to get to reception. No signs at all for people arriving that way. In fact the hotel survey didn’t even offer bus as a option on the question of how we got there.We arrived at 10am after a long flight and got a room immediately. Perfect. We checked out and put our luggage in the valet area and we’re able to have a shower when we picked it up later in the day.We have been there, done the pool. But we are not tempted to go back.",50,1
216,Undeniably one of the most iconic and most popular hotel in all of singapore. The hotel is huge! And although it is a 5 star luxury hotel. It doesn’t feel like it when entering the lobby. It feels like entering a mall because of the tourist coming in and out of the hotel. I just hope there is a separate lobby for hotel guest to check in and check out. Got a corner room facing gardens by the bay. The room is huge with spectacular views. Although the room i got has no bathtub. The amenities and the views makes up for it. Never in my life have I experienced lining up for check in and check out which took me about 10-20mins of waiting. The skydeck pool was amazing. Possibly the only reason why people stay here. Aside from direct access to the Shoppes. If you want to stay here try to book a club room for more exclusive access to the club lounge. ,30,1
217,We stayed again in the Marina Bay. But this time my husband and I had a friend with us who visited Singapore for the first time. First: shuttle service perfect Second: Sands Suite: amazing(with the pool table! You definitely want the pool table!)Third: service and staff - like always: excellent.His expression: he didn’t get the smileOut of his face ;-)I absolutely love this hotel and its people. I would always come here again for visit. It feels like coming home. ,50,1
218,"My partner and I stayed here for one night to treat ourselves whilst backpacking. The service was amazing straight away from check in. The room was lovely, we paid extra to have a city view and were put on the 53rd floor, it was so beautiful. We had a lovely dinner at a celebrity restaurant in the Marina Bay Shops, spent time in the day and evening in the infinity pool and even got free cake from the reception sent up to our room. Such a perfect stay and the best 24 hours. Thank you to all the staff. Can’t wait to come back and stay for a week or two!",50,1
219,"This was our second time staying at Marina Bay Sands - we stayed two nights on our way home from Europe to get back on our own timezone.We arrived in the morning after a 14 flight with our 4yo and we were given a room early and able to head up to the Infinity Pool - the perfect way to stay awake after an exhausting flight.The rooms are huge and comfortable, service is prompt, helpful and polite and the breakfast at Spago is always a highlight. This time we had a view to the Gardens by the Bay, which are spectacular to see at nighttime. The lower rooms also have a balcony which is a bonus.Spending two days by the pool at Marina Bay Sands was the perfect way to relax and shake off any jet lag - would highly recommend for a Singapore stopover, or a longer stay. ",50,1
220,"The room are lovely, infinity pool and 57th oit spectacular, the place has its own theatre, casino and metro stop, views incredible, key location- it is so expensive you will shudder but just has to be visited. ",50,1
221,"The MBS is obviously one of the world's most iconic hotels. Economic supply and demand considered, I'm not certain it's worth the money (although it does come close).From the exterior, the hotel was stunning. Regarding the interior, my room was very nice and views from hotel rooms either overlook the Garden by the Bay and its beautiful nightly light shows or the stunning skyline of Singapore city. The lobby, although grand, invoked considerations of an amusement park: huge; long lines (for check-in, check-out, the concierge, etc.); hundreds of people (hotel guests and non-guests taking pics); etc. The lobby was undergoing renovations and some additional cleaning (e.g. the ceiling over reception) is necessary.The pool was spectacular but was unfortunately crowded on the four occasions I accessed the rooftop.The gym was good and the staff helpful. All hotel staff were excellent: friendly; professional; etc. Special mention needs to be made of Azan, the incredibly knowledgeable and helpful concierge, and of the staff who organized a delicious cake for my birthday.The hotel's amenities, ranging from the mini-bar to the restaurants and bars, were very expensive, even for a hotel of the MBS' standard.The MBS is good for the bucket list but when considering value for money in the luxury category, unlike the Terminator, I doubt I'll be back.",50,1
222,"I arrived earlier than the check-in time, but the room was ready eventhough I didn’t ask for early check-in.The room is very spacious and has amazing view. If you get rooms on lower floor, you’ll get balcony, while on higher floor you get stunning view of Singapore’s skyline.It was a business trip but luckily I had time to enjoy the facilities in the hotel. The infinity pool is just amazing. There are good restaurants and shops in the hotel area. I didn’t even need to leave the hotel area during my entire stay.I didn’t have much interaction with the staffs during my stay, but the housekeeping did impressive job in making up the room for my entire stay. Qiao Yu made up my room during this stay and she did a great job. She even folded my clothes and replenish the amenities with more than what I need.Overall it was a wonderful stay. Highly recommended!",40,1
223,"Who wouldn't want to experince the much-talked-about 57th floor infinity pool? Hotel guests enjoys discounts at Banyan Tree Spa and Fitness Club. If you're a shopaholic, more than 270 retail stores at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands & you get 10% discount if you're a Hotel guest in some stores. The Skypark is the best place to chase sunset and see the beauty of city skyline.On the other side, catch sunrise overlooking Gardens By The Bay. ",50,1
224,"the infinity pool is to die for , the breakfast is amazing and best staying experience. If you can take higher floors you can surly love the view.. the mall is has best brands and casino is amazing . Total a 5 star experiance",50,1
225,"It deserves a stay, but not just an overnight, you have to live it fully, I had an upgrade to one of the last floors and my view over the bay was spectacular.Spacious and wonderfully furnished, one of the most beautiful bathrooms I’ve had.Then the gym with the perfect view, and best of it all is obviously the infinity pool.Loved every corner of it.",50,1
226,It was a dream for me to stay in Marina Bay Sands when i travel to Singapore.it's one of a kind hotel with an amazing infinite pool overlooking the harbor from the top of the hotel. The location is very good close to Gardens by the Bay which has a stunning light and music show every night. connected to a big shopping mall with varieties of shops and restaurants. The rooms are spacious with luxury amenities. Service with a very high quality from all staff.,50,1
227,"I came here for business and stayed for 3 nights. Got upgrade to the premier room with Balcony which is really exceeded my expectation! First of all, the service is amazing. Even it’s a 2500 rooms hotel, but the front office agent is professional and keep smiling all the days. The room located on 33rd floor. The view at the balcony is unbreakable and can see the whole garden by the bay.I would say the housekeeping did very well and they fill up your amenities based on your personality. Like if I drank all bottle of water on the first day, they refill double of them on the next day. And the in room dining and pressing service is very professional, they can deliver my order to my room on time everyday.The infinite pool is a must visit pool in the world and it is much nicer than I expect.A little walk after dinner around the lake and garden by the bay is recommended, and the weather at night is cool.But the WiFi is actually not fast, unless you upgraded it to premium WiFi. The overall experience is amazing, and I must come back in the future. Thanks mbs for providing me such great hospitality during my stay! ",50,1
228,"My wife and I stayed here on a two day connection as we explored Southern Asia. Mid October, which is still technically the rainy season so I am guessing a little quieter. The place was busy but not crowded. Of course it is expensive but the staff were wonderful , accommodating and friendly.  We arrived very early and were allowed to check in and were also given the courtesy of a late check out.  Both were much appreciated. Our room was spotless and the view was spectacular. Food and drinks are extremely pricey but again not surprising for one of the most iconic hotels in the world. You only live once folks so if you are on the fence, just do it. Just think of your Instagram feed!",50,1
229,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for a weekend in Singapore. The views from the top are unbeatable. The restaurants and bars on the roof are lovely, and we really enjoyed having such easy access to them. We enjoyed a lovely dinner at Lavo (I had a delicious vegetarian meal) and many great cocktails at Spago.The rooms are a decent size, and the decor is nice, although not trendy - but that's dependent on taste of course! We found it easy to get around from the hotel. The metro is easy to get to and you can walk to lots of places.I would say though that it is not a personal hotel and whilst the staff are friendly and I'm sure always happy to help it doesn't feel like you get much service. The check in lobby is essentially in the shopping centre so doesn't feel special. The pool very much feels like a 'selfie pool' and is very busy - not somewhere you can fully relax. You have to use your keycard to open the gates to enter the pool area, and I fully understand it's to stop non hotel residents entering, but it also adds to the leisure centre feel. You also have to queue to get the lifts up to the top and back down again as there are so many people. Considering the price tag, it's the worst hotel experience we've had in a hotel of this price range. There are so many rooms and it feels quite underwhelming. If it wasn't for the rooftop you could be forgiven for thinking you were in an oversized airport hotel. (You obviously can't see the impressive architecture of the building itself from the inside).It's a rooftop experience and not a luxurious hotel experience. We had a very nice weekend, and we've now ticked off staying at the Marina Bay Sands. I think it's somewhere we definitely wanted to stay once.The hotel is so famous and iconic to Singapore which makes it exciting to be there, but we probably wouldn't jump at the opportunity to stay again on a return trip.

230,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a night. The hotel itself is an attraction and the stay was a good experience. There was just an issue with the keycards being rejected several times so we had to have it changed at the front desk which is kind of hassle but overall, stay was good. Shout out to Aslam of Front Desk for the superb service during check in",30,1
231,"I have stayed at the magnificent MBS two times with last time in December 2017. I was attending a conference at the Convention Center within the MBS. I had garden view room, on a high floor in tower 2. The experience of Infinity pool, Ce La Vi and the multiple breakfast options made the stay completely perfect and memorable.",40,1
232,Check in and check out smoothly...The room is big and very clean..the amenities is abundant!! The air con is very cold..easy access to mrt..Lot of restaurant nearby..theres also 7eleven near the mrt station..A little bit overpriced for me.,50,1
233,"This is a vast, immense hotel and we had some initial concerns about whether or not the service at such a large hotel would live up to the price. It did. From the beginning, we were whisked away into a VIP checkin line and the process was quick. We had a room on the 47th floor looking at the city. The room was modern, spacious, and beautifully appointed. The staff put welcome amenities in our room for our honeymoon. The pool deck is the centerpiece, with commanding views out over the city of Singapore. Pool service was a little slow, but the view made up for it.One individual in particular was the concierge, who was amazing. We lost our wallet during our stay and this gentleman went above and beyond to help us locate and coordinate its return via the taxi system. He was an exceptional person for helping us out!! Great hotel, highly recommended!",50,1
234,In my opinion Marina Bay Sands is where your Singapore visit should begin (and end). I stayed three nights in a Sky View room and simply loved everything about the hotel. I had the pleasure of early check-in and unwinding at the unforgettable infinity pool on floor 57 before exploring further. This is what Singapore is all about. No trip is proper without dipping yourself in those world famous waters. The view is breath-taking and service is very friendly. Food and beversge is very reasonably priced in the pool area. I had a slight issue in my bathroom but hotel staff was very responsive and it was resolved in the blink of an eye. Very professional.The hotel itself is gigantic but staff is doing its best to accomodate all guests. I have nothing to complain about as everyone was super helpful.Gym is nice with a view and morning yoga classes are spectacular too.I find breakfast a bit pricey but there is plenty of food options at shoppes at MBS.Highly recommended for everyone planning to visit Singapore!,50,1
235,We had fantastic coffee and cake in one of the foyer cafes. Also went to the bar on the 57th floor. This is above the viewing platform and costs $20 pp admission fee which is offset against any drinks you buy. Beer and a glass of wine both cost about $10-15 so you get to enjoy a drink on the roof top bar and stay to enjoy the view and relax. You can eat there too but we didn’t do that. We purchased our tickets at ground level of tower 3. Better than the viewing platform in our opinion.  Loved it and it was a fabulously bright day.,50,1
236,"The title says it all, as you would probably expected from a hotel this size it cannot offer a personal feel because of the sheer volume of guests it caters to. We stayed in a Club Room with Seaview over the Beautiful Gardens by the Bay. The view is indeed incredible as is the eclectic city, however the staff let themselves down a bit with her excessive efficiency, you cannot break the rules to go above and beyond for guests. I would say the place caters more to the tastes of the business break, and the posers in life. It's clean and functional as you would expect in Singapore. ",50,1
237,Pros: Great views if you are up high (was on 48th floor). Thanks to friendly staff for earlier and quiet check-in and letting me to stay as high as i wanted with garden view on offer. Room was clean and daily serviced. The pool is worth a stay itself. Not too busy. And cant speak enough of great views of Singapore city from 57th floor. Justifies the price you pay. Loved the random photo model lookalikes doing their shoots in the pool area..good value for some laughs!Cons: shopping and eating out is very $$$! Lucky I wasn't into shopping at Marina Bay Sands and it was fairly easy to eat elsewhere.Definitely worth a visit but if you don't like people (i mean lots) and are keen shopaholic but don't want spend too much $$ than this is not the place for you.,40,1
238,"Stayed two nights at MBS. Got a room with a view, overseeing Gardens by the Bay. Magnificent view, great services provided. Friendly staffs. Definitely recommended even for a staycation if you are able to splurge for the room upgrade ",50,1
239, We are from Sri Lanka We were greeted at the desk wonderfully and were given really nice rooms and close together as we are  4 in 2 room. Nice Views were fantastic although the pool was overcrowded. we used hot tub ,40,1
240,We were greeted at the desk wonderfully and were given really nice rooms and close together as we are a party of four.  Views were fantastic although the pool was overcrowded. I enjoyed the hot tub most of all.  ,50,1
241,"Forget it...toooooo busy and way way over the top, no real people ie average people shop here... versace, ferrari jun ??? While eating very ordinary chinese etc..... talk about showing off ....dont bother, go to Raffles city for a very reasonable meal at reasonable prices",50,1
242,"We had three fantastic nights in the amazing hotel. This was a stop-off on our way home from a holiday in Bali. We treated ourselves to a Club room which gave us access to Club 55 for free cocktails and canapés each night. This was excellent and very much worth the additional money. The hotel itself is breathtaking. The whole structure and pool are really amazing ... you have to see it to believe it. I think we had a better experience because we had paid for the upgrade so the room was bigger and the lounge access was excellent. We didn't have to queue for breakfast like some of the other guests so this was a real bonus. The views from the hotel are amazing whether you have a city or ocean view. The staff are very efficient, polite, helpful and very professional. My only slight complaint was that the Club room check in area was not well managed. We actually checked in quicker than many others by doing it in the main lobby. This is an amazing place and one that you need to tick off your list. Definitely worth a visit.",10,1
243,"Our 52nd floor suite was outstanding, as was the service from special check in for customers paying for a suite. Also complementary breakfast, membership of Club 55 with free champagne, canapés etc. 5-7pm.the fabulous infinity pool (the biggest its type in the world, the light shows and great Hospitality made it a very special experience",50,1
244,"We stayed here earlier this year in June, whilst at a conference in the near by exhibition center which made it an easy commute.  The hotel is truly expansive ! 3 imposing towers. Check in was not too bad as we arrived quite late. We had a great room with lovely views of the garden lights.The security is visible and you can not enter the lifts to your tower without the key.The staff are friendly and helpful considering its such a huge hotel. The lobby area is so busy it feels like a train station ,as there are tourists not staying in the hotel coming to the viewing deck.In my opinion this is a once off great experience to see the hotel and take in  the views and the infinity pool which is wow ! ( only available for hotel guests use)personally i did not get into it as it was so overcrowded and selfie sticks in every spot of the pool and did not appeal to me. I took the photos and that was enough.It is very expensive, drinks and food and just way too busy for me. its like been there done that got the T shirt kind of place for me.",50,1
245,"I stayed here at the end of September with my sister whilst I was in Singapore for work. The hotel is super sized and because of that it’s exceptionally busy and has an “airport” fee and not at all exclusive.Check in was fast for us but when arriving at our room (Garden View Suite) we were given a room on level 2, so all we could see was a hedge and VERY noisy (like sleeping on the motorway) so I requested a new room. I would recommend anyone to only get a room from floor 9 and above!! This was of course granted with no fuss and I was emailed when the room was ready - we were given complimentary pool room keys while we waited. We were very shortly advised that a new room on level 54 was available. The room was lovely, super quiet, spacious and luxurious with designer toiletries. The view was spectacular but on the grand scheme of things $881 a night was just NOT justified in my opinion. Especially when the curtains didn’t close fully so we were awoken very early!!! I guess I just prefer the more “personal/private” hotel.The pool was very crowded (regardless of time) and although the water and view is amazing, it lost its “exclusivity” and feels more like a fancy public pool. Staff were lovely and food and drink was amazing, and Lavo on the roof is spectacular, but I have to say I would not stay there again.",40,1
246,The best luxury hotel in Singapore. Amazing views of the hanging Garden. No words for world highest and longest pool. The view of city from the pool makes you feel that you are floating in the cloud. Incredible experience !,30,1
247,"What a big hotel was my thought on the queue for check in. We were an hour in line, though staff passed by every 15 minutes or so with juice, or water, or ice cream. Anything to help make the wait more comfortable.The 3 tower 57 stories high sky scraper is just big.It takes days to get the place, but withe the large infinity pool, great viewd, comfortable rooms, it is a must at least once in Singapore to be there.Best breakfast with a vast choice is in Tower 1 on the ground floor. Best view but with limited view on the 57th floor in Tower 2.",50,1
248,"Excellent hotel,fantastic views but extremely busy. Took 1hour to check in. The infinity pool is stunning but very crowded even in the rain and at 7am in the morning. Because it is so big I probably wouldn't stay there again just because of the crowds.",50,1
249,"Upgraded to a fabolous two bedroom suite with gym, massage room and hairdresser´s inside. Wonderful views over de botanical gardens. Huge living room, dinning room, office facilities, domotic control of lights, televisions, blinders... Private lobby and lift to 50th floor. Butler to catter for ice, nespresso capsules and morning full breakfast. And what else to say about the world famous rooftop swimming pool? Incredible experience!",40,1
250,"People stay here for obvious reasons - the iconic hotel (it’s on most souvenir items and if you google Singapore - this hotel is bound to show up) and the pool. Actual hotel itself:The hotel itself is average. A subpar, modern, city looking hotel. It is a very big hotel which is split into 3 ‘towers’/sections - 1, 2 and 3. As the hotel is so big, it lacked the ‘personal’ touch. A bonus for staying here is that you can use the observatory deck for free. Rooms: The rooms were ‘meh’. We opted for a city view and in my opinion, that was the best feature of the room. The room decor is nothing to boast about, very old fashioned and outdated - I’ve stayed in nicer rooms for a fraction of the price. We stayed in a normal room and I was disappointed to see that there was no bathtub in the room. The wifi is strong. Staff:Reception staff - not friendly at all, some actually spoke about us (in a different language) while looking directly at us - very unprofessional. There was a lot of back and forth email prior to our stay and the hotel was very responsive. Pool staff - very friendly and always greeted us with a smile and answered any questions we had. Kudos to them! Special mention to Ryan Goh (lifeguard). Had a good chat with him about Singapore and he gave me some tips for my trip - thanks, Ryan!Breakfast:Breakfast itself was good - I opted for ‘Arise(?)’. Was it worth the money? No. It was 53/54 SGD - there were A LOT of variety and options but it lacked in the quality. Everything I tried was subpar. The highlight was that the staff were kind and friendly though. Pool:Now onto the main event and probably the main reason everyone stays here - THE POOL. I like that ONLY hotel guests can use the pool (no day pass is available). You enter the pool by using your room card/key - each person has their own key. The pool provided excellent views of the city. The pool itself was perfect depth as it wasn’t too deep (I can’t swim lol). There were many sunbeds available so you don’t have to wake up at 6am to ‘reserve’ one. The staff do remove towels when guests are MIA for too long. I loved the pool and stayed there all the time - who needs to eat when you can chill at the pool? The pools get cleaned everyday at 3.30pm (pool 1) and 4pm (pool 2). Overall, do I recommend staying here? Yes, mainly for the pool. I think it’s a good experience to say that you’ve stayed at the highest infinity pool. Would I return? Probably not. I don’t think it was worth the money and I have enough pictures at the pool to last me a lifetime. ",50,1
251,"The hotel is of course one of the most high-end hotels in Singapore and that shows. The whole complex speaks luxury, also the easy access to the electric trees and cloud dome is very convenient. Never the less the whole experience comes at a certain price which was in my opinion quite overpriced. Except the pool which in theory can not be accessed by non guests, the rest is publicly accessible and can also be enjoyed while staying in an equally nice but a lot cheaper hotel somewhere else in Singapore.",40,1
252,"So took the pics in the infinity pool and instagrammed it. Not coming back. For two main reasons. First, it’s way overpriced for what it is. Second, it’s way too far away from the city. I’d rather stay in a similar room at the Hilton and pay half the price!The room was ok, nothing special. Infinity pool is nice, but over crowded. Restaurants are ok (tried breakfast and dinner). One thing going for this place is the proximity to the gardens by the bay and the science museum.Overall, nothing special. I can’t see myself going back when there’s enough choice in the city.",30,1
253,"This is simply a great, iconic Singapore hotel that ought not to be missed. Spectacular design from outside and inside. Great rooms. The roof-top pool is a wonder of engineering...try a cocktail while relaxing on the infinity edge, looking over the city. The rooftop bards are great although the staff at Adrift make for an even better experience. We liked the foot in Cést la vie restaurant - and Adrfit. Lavo was OK.",30,1
254,"It is with a heavy heart that I write this review. I had early morning arrival in SIN so got to Marina Bay Sands reception at around 7 AM. They were nice enough to give me early check-in and upgrade to Premier room for SGD 60 extra. They have deducted equivalent of USD 250 from my debit card as a deposit since I had no credit car on me at the time. Everything went great. The room had a balcony with incredible views of Gardens By The Bay, spacious bathroom and comfortable bed. Rooftop pool and jacuzzi are out of this world. A must-experience kind of thing. But...Months after my stay I was going through my bank statement and noticed that my deposit was never refunded. I left the room spotless so I was sure this is definitely not a consequence of my own actions. I contacted the hotel to rectify this matter. I was told my query was passed on to the relevant department and everything will be sorted out quickly but this wasn't the case. I sent numerous chasers and got replies that they will look into this at their earliest. They never did and even stopped replying to my reminders. Bottom line: I was scammed. I wouldn't go as far as calling it  their company policy but it sure as hell was not an honest mistake... Needless to say, this completely ruined my experience.",50,1
255,"Visited in November. Great place, great service, infinity pool, great location, superb view. The service were great. They even left a complimentary cake as a birthday treat. You need access for infinity pool.Loads of shopping places within. Garden by bay is just near by so is merlion park. Singapore light show is another best highlights and marina bay sand is the best place to view it from.",20,1
256,"Honestly, one of the best expetiences ever!! The que for getting up was a little bit too long, but totally understand why people love this place.Would love to swim in the pool - but only for hotel guests unfortunately :(",50,1
257,We stayed at MBS for one night as a once in a lifetime experience even though we live in Singapore! Ryan Goh an amazing help at the pool!! He’s the lifeguard but super helpful for everything related to the hotel and Singapore! Very friendly and approachable - great woth kids - seek him out!! Sheree,50,1
258,We stayed two nights at the hotel as a stopover from Australia to the UK and we had a room on 47th floor with amazing views. The hotel staff were friendly and polite and we had no complaints over our room. The view from the 57th floor with the infinity pool were simply mind boggling and we took loads of photos. The only thing we did find annoying was the fact that a $20 bottle of rose wine outside the hotel cost $120 in the hotel restaurant which we thought too steep!,50,1
259,"We caught MRT to the Sands.Can also taxi, slightly more expensive (adds S$2-4) as there is a drop off/pickup fee at Sands.loved just walking through this massive building to admire the architecture, shops all too flashy (Gucci, Prada, etc), didn't do the roof top experience as expensive at S$21 adult and you are confined where you can go on the roof top. They even have a canal in here with boats!We also visited the Art + Science Museum (super awesome) which is located right beside here.",40,1
260,Is not worst to stay too expensive and the service is not very good ....and to visit the pool is only one key card one entrance we stay there is to celebrate my husband birthday..my family came to celebrate together we went to the pool my family cannot get in ...when we book we are not told that to get in to the pool need to have the key card ...,40,0
261,"Loved the stay here totally. After work, I had a lot of places to go around the hotel for a run. The infinity pool is amazing. I loved the complimentary chocolate buffet on the eve (as a room package). Good variety in the breakfast menu. As a hotel guest, I also had a complimentary entry to Gardens By the bay. Overall a wonderful experience. I am taking my family here again during Diwali break!",10,1
262,"It took me some time to think about this review, so that my personal experience of this hotel is fair and not because I was disappointed and jumped in this review. After almost a week, I still came back to the same conclusion. It is definitely not worth the money. We stayed for 2 nights & we did regret it. We became another curious tourist stats wanting to experience the infinity pool and to check the view from above at the Observation deck. If you really do want to check out the hotel, then here are my advice. Take on the City View room and stay there for only one night. Use the pool between 6am - 7:30am if you are planning to actually swim in it. If you are like most of the other guests who are only in the pool for photos, I guess it doesn't matter what time. Tip: At night the place is pack! I am not sure if you really want to be in that water.Great things about it - central and convenient to Gardens by the Bay, the Casino, MRT and the Shopping Centre. They are walking distance for checking out Rhapsody at Supertree and Spectra. The view from Observation Deck (hotel guests only) at Level 57 at night... Is spectacular! The architecture of the hotel is pretty amazing, whilst I do questioned the carbon footprint of the hotel blasting super cold aircon in the foyer across 3 towers. The pool at the crack of dawn is quite nice because you can actually swim in it and is somewhat 'cleaner'. Thank god for adult only section pool, don't get me wrong I don't mind kids but screaming splashing kids is really not my idea of a relaxing holiday by the pool. Not so great things/borderline rather disappointed things about it - from the moment we enter into our room we noticed a faint sewage smell from the toilet bowl. Odd and no we didn't complaint as it wasn't terrible although not what you expect from this hotel. The pool... 3 things stood for us. Lack of showers around the pool given it is the world's largest rooftop infinity pool - I found 2 and even that I had to ask - hence the somewhat 'clean' pool. 2 toilet facilities one inside and one outside - what the? Lastly, the lack of choices and quality of the poolside menu. Upon arrival with the long check in queue, the lobby and sheer volume of people hanging around, reminded me of a day time market. Overall, this is the most expensive hotel I've stayed in to date and what I got in return is half the value. I've stayed in much nicer hotel both in service and quality for half the price. There; my husband and I was another statistic for the hotel. I can't imagine myself going back at all or recommend this place to others.",50,0
263,"We stayed at this amazing hotel in Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands is in a fantastic location with absolutely breath taking views of the Marina and the surrounds. Upon entering this amazing hotel it almost feels as though you are on a different planet with the sheer beauty and the size of this hotel. The room that we stayed in was beautifully decorated, clean and the facilities were of the highest quality. The bed that we slept in was mega comfortable, resulting in heavenly sleeps. The views from the bedroom was to die for, absolutely stunning. The food and the service provided was of the highest quality with some wonderful staff. Overall this was a most wonderful short stay and it was very difficult to say goodbye.",30,1
264,"I highly recommend this hotel! The rooms, the hospitality, the service, facilities are in the highest level and its definitely worth every single penny! The pool is breathtaking..I recommend to choose the highest floor you can get.Don't think twice!!",50,1
265,"My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 8 nights in September (2018) for the Formula 1. I had previously read reviews that said the check in process could be really slow. We arrived at the hotel at about 5.30 p.m. and had no problems checking in. It was straight forward. The room we stayed in was  excellent. It was a really good size, very comfortable and could not fault it in any way. It was definitely worth paying the extra for the city view as this was breathtaking. Although, a garden view room would also be good (particularly as you could watch the light show in Supertree grove). We ate a few times in the hotel (room service and Lavo restaurant). The food was always excellent. Would definitely recommend Lavo as the food was great, not badly priced and the view you get whilst dining is second to none. The infinity pool is an obvious draw to the hotel and a once in a lifetime experience. I used the pool early in the morning (around 6.30 a.m.). Would recommend going in early before it gets too busy and you get to see the sunrise from the pool.Overall, it was an excellent stay. There is nothing that I can fault the hotel on. It would definitely be top of my list to book again if I visit Singapore in the future.",50,1
266,"This was an amazing hotel. We stayed In a club room. Very spacious, ocean view. Very large bathroom.  Really lovely room. Club room gave us a dining room on floor 55 which gave us free afternoon tea and free drinks and canapés. The staff in here were very attentive , informative and helpful. I can’t say enough . A fabulous 3 days.Don’t forget a trip up to the pool on the roof. You must see it early evening. The view was incredible.",50,1
267,"We stayed here thinking that it might be the only chance we might get. We weren’t disappointed, everything at this hotel was perfect. Just wish we’d had longer to explore the hotel facilities, shops and casino.The service was excellent from the early check in to the anniversary cake.Could have stayed in the pool for a whole week and still wanted more.The staff were very friendly and helpful.The only tiny downside is the fact that it is such a huge hotel, with so many guests, that it doesn’t feel personal enough but that goes for far smaller hotels these days too.Given the chance we would definitely go back, and for longer",50,1
268,"We expected a level of service and quality from a hotel with this reputation and price for a room.   It fell flat when we waited an hour in the check in queue where only 3 people were serving.   It was hot in that area and no offer of water until we reached the counter.    The room was ok the shower floor was incredibly slippery to the point of dangerous.   The pool wasn't really clean and water was like a warm bath.   We had to order milk to the room and had to pay for half a jug of milk and not provision in the room.   There was nothing impressive about this hotel that would make me come back. When we advised at check out things were not up to standard there was a totally blank look and no acknowledgement.   It is fair to say I will never be back.We had stayed at the Pan Pacific in Raffle Blvd prior to Marina Bay Sands and I couldn't fault the hotel, staff and service. I will be back there in a heartbeat it was just disappointing we made the mistake of going to Marina Bay Sands for a night",50,1
269,"During our honeymoon stop over at the Pan Pacific Hotel we had extensive views of the Marina Bay from our hotel balcony which made it easy for us to determine where to walk and view the Marina Bay up close. There are plenty of activity options to suit all age groups in, on and around Marina Bay.",30,1
270,"We enjoyed our experience. It is a busy shopping and hospitality operation. Hotel staff are well trained and efficient. Concierge service is world class. Rooms are clean, tidy, sizable and comfortable but lack draw space and a lighting plan that is easy to use. There are plenty of elevators serving the 2600 rooms in three towers. The hotel is accessible to the city and sits on an MRT station. The MRT will put the traveller any where in Singapore quickly and comfortably.The hotel needs more breakfast options as an expensive buffet is not for everyone. We ate breakfast in the shopping complex but found choice limited. Hotel restaurants and bars are excellent but charge world prices. Again, we found their food fantastic and service friendly, courteous and efficient.The roof top swimming pool with the world's largest infinity pool is great and closely managed for comfort and security reasons. Well worth the visit!Unless you want the casino experience, Marina Bay Sands is enjoyable and there are other places to stay and enjoy in Singapore.",50,1
271,"Like most reviews, it's all about the pool -how many of us would stay if we could pay a ""day rate"" for access to the pool? I would say the hotel occupancy would probably fall dramatically and maybe they would then charge a more realistic rate.... To put it into context, based on historic reviews it was obvious to me that staying one night would be enough to enable me to tick it off my ""bucket list"" so for the rest of my time in Singapore I stayed elsewhere for half the price for a far more superior hotel experience!It's a massive hotel so don't expect 5* service albeit the staff try hard but don't always succeed e.g. I had a reservation at Lavo which coincided with my birthday which they recognised upon entering the restaurant but failed to follow up with a gesture of a cake/similar.For lots of people wifi is important, we found reception to be sporadic (cut off frequently) and overall poor quality.In summary my 5 top tips:1) Don't upgrade to a Club room -in my view it's not worth the extra and it's also one of the most dissappointing Club experiences I've ever had. It's more like a canteen with basic food presentations. When I was leaving there were lots of (frustrated) guests queueing to get in as the place was rammed full. Not sure how many of them would have got the full benefit of what was on offer as it was 6.30pm and it closed at 7pm. If you do opt for a Club room, go at 5pm'ish when it opens..2) Rooms are quite a few years old now and are bland -my room was about 75m2 which is very large but it was soulless. The bathroom was large with a double vanity but it had a tiny wardrobe. Like Club rooms, in hindsight don't see the point in paying for a ""better"" grade as even the cheapest rooms come with a premium price tag.3) Go early to the pool to bag a bed but also be aware that lots of guests come late when other guests have left for the day and sit by the pool as it gets dark for the evening laser show.4) Be aware that the hotel operates about 3 or 4 restaurants for breakfast and even then there are queues so find out from staff when are the quieter times, which is probably before 9am as you could be queueing for ages.....5) Stay one night and save your money for a more superior hotel experience elsewhere for the remaining time in SingaporeTicked it off my bucket list, just wish it had been a more memorable birthday as apart from the pool exerience it was (sadly) disappointing.",50,1
272,"We went there as a couple from 2-3 october 2018.i was very unsure of the dates before. So i cancelled that booking. I was still charged a whopping 775 sgd. On inquiry, they said i made 2 bookings (WHICH WAS NOT TRUE), one of which was a no show and one i cancelled. I read about this trick on trip advisor. But i paid no heed until obviously it happened to us. Furthermore they now said it was a duplicated booking and the money will be returned after 15 days. After they earn some interest money on our credit card that is . The view from the infinity pool and the rooms is breathtaking. The pool is always crowded. Except for maybe 7-8 am in the morning. We were honeymooners, we recieved surprise chocolates at 7 pm. Nice personalized touch!  The hotel is huge. And has a marina shoppes mall attached to it, which has some amazing celebrity restaurants. We tried the bird and the fried chicken was out of this world. Except for the trickery, a very good stay",30,1
273,"Since this hotel was built back in 2010, this tri-building with a connected top floor for swimming and events became an instant landmark tourist attraction. Many would post pictures of themselves with the bay behind them and the facade of this hotel in the background. Hotel rates are expected to be high, especially during peak seasons like holidays or during the GP (F1) weekend. Access to the pool is draconianly strict, even if you have a baby with you, he/she will have to badge with every ingress and egress to the pool area. I guess due to the popularity of the pool area, people have been trying to access it even illegally. My badge actually failed a couple of times and I was questioned on my booking details which was quite annoying. Anyway, the rooms are functional but cramped, not unlike our stay at the Fairmont Hotel where the room was 3X bigger at less than half the price for a day's stay.  I'm not saying this to drive you away from this hotel, being able to swim in the pool on top of the city of Singapore was well worth the so-so room. Bucket list checked! We practically spent most of our time outside the hotel room anyway as we were checking all the attractions in the Marina Bay Area which would take more than a hurried day to take all in. To conclude, despite everything, the stay was worth it, I would definitely recommend.",20,1
274,On arrival at the hotel everyone we met from exiting the taxi to entering our room were extremely welcoming. Our room was modern and very tastefully decorated. All of the amenities were of a high quality and we had a magnificent view over the harbour. The Skypark with its infinity pool and unforgettable view over Singapore is an experience not to be missed and the Gardens are a must see. We had a great time there and would highly recommend it,40,1
275,"Marina Bay Sands lives up to its standards as one of the top hotels in Singapore, with the highest infinity pool in the World. The hotel itself was busy and buzzing with events and conferences, with people from all over the World. It provides various shopping opportunities and you are spoilt for choice for dining opportunities.The facilities and amenities are top-notch with the Infinity Pool located at the 57th floor and the Banyan Tree Spa & Fitness Facilities at the 55th floor, accessible to Hotel guests. The bars & lounges also provide for a good reprieve to unwind.The Banyan Tree Fitness Gym overlooks the Marina Bay district and allows for a great workout with equipment from Technogym and Kinetika. The gym also provides a hot bath, steam room and sauna for patrons. Raj, was particularly welcoming, ensuring to remember the names of guests (no easy task!) and ensuring all needs are provided. I particularly enjoyed going to the fitness club daily.The rooms in Marina Bay Sands are spacious, provides the amenities you might need for a comfortable stay. The bathroom is equipped with a large tub for you to soak your worries away and comes with a separate en suite shower and toilet. The bathroom is large enough for you to run around in if the room isn't enough.A worthwhile location to stay in when you're in Singapore, conveniently located above the MRT like which connects you to the Public Transport system.",50,1
276,Simply amazing hotel !! from checkin to checkout were spotless! we booked the room which overlooked Club 55 - which was well worth it! the meals included in it were delicious! the pool is breathtaking .. do not need too much description about it !! the breakfast (in the case of those who opted for club 55) had the option of being in 4 different places .. very well served (we opted to take the Rise- which is on the 1st floor) with a multitude of foods of various places in the world !! about the room ?? it was huge and overlooking the whole city of Singapore) .. we will return to Singapore and we will stay again in this hotel for sure !!!,50,1
277,We loved everything about this hotel and it was just what we needed after a long flight from London. The rooms were very spacious and well catered for. The bathroom nice and large with a great shower. Views from all rooms. The pool was just amazing and the reason we booked this hotel. A great place to relax and quite spectacular. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and there excellent eating choices available in all price ranges. I would definitely stay here again.,50,1
278,"Just a fantastic hotel. Great bars, food, staff. A lovely place to spend time, The shopping mall is fantastic all the best shops in one place, a great day out even if you are only window shopping you can still have a good time",50,1
279,"When visiting Singapore the Marina Bay Sands is always our first choice. The breathtaking architecture with the gorgeous Infinity Pool at the top is just one aspect of this spectacular venue. The service level at the Marina Bay Sands is exceptional. If you choose a room at the Club Level you are in for some special treats, highly recommended. The huge complex has direct access to the MRT system for a quick and conveniant getting around and the huge shopping center is a shoppers delight.",50,1
280,"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon.  We landed in the morning and by the time we were at the hotel it was approx 9am.  We were greeted by the concierge who took our luggage and directed us to the check-in desk.First impressions were wow, however, it was extremely busy.  The line for check-in was long and we waited about 45 mins before we managed to speak to someone.  We upgraded our room by the recommendation of the member of staff (who was very nice) and were given some gifts as it was our honeymoon.The upgraded room was the premium room on the 46th floor with a balcony.  We were very happy with the room.  It was spacious and the bathroom was amazing. The decor was ok but nice enough.In respect of the facilities there are the main things you want, but also it has the appeal of an infinity pool, which was very nice, however, VERY busy - and this was the main issue with the hotel.The hotel is filled with guests as well as tourists as it has become a tourist attraction in itself.  What doesn’t help is that the hotel is adjoined to a mall.  Furthermore, with approx 2000 rooms across the three towers most of the facilities were full.  The infinity pool during the day was ridiculously busy.  The gym was quite small, given the size of the hotel and was in tower 2, which mean either going to the ground floor or the top floor walk across and use another lift in tower 2.In respect of Breakfast - we did not include this within our booking, and good that we didn’t as we woke up very late during our stay and wouldn’t have had a chance to try it.  So cannot comment on how good the food was.We did, however, have dinner at Lavo rooftop bar and restaurant, which if i’m being honest is overpriced for average food.  The views are very nice and nicely decorated but I expected more and wasn’t blown away with the service.Overall, I would say that our stay was a good experience, however, if you’re looking for a personal service and relaxing, quiet environment, this is not the place for you as it is very busy.  Its a nice, clean hotel but it is missing that special feeling which I have had in other places. The staff are very friendly and service was good (but that is the case in SE Asia mostly).  ",50,1
281,"I booked this hotel via booking.com, and it was not very clear to me that the price quoted was sans 10% + 7%. Also do not park not enter near tower 3 ( which is the first you get to) drive on and enter at tower 1 and ‘give’ you car to the valet. Cannot believe at this price there is no free parking nor breakfast included. The buffet is 53$++ how can they justify...The room was huge, well appointed and very comfortableFamily room- make sure you check- in everybody and get plenty of cards- otherwise cannot use the pool!",40,1
282,"I guess it is a combination of spending time with two of my favourite women in the world, getting a great offer from a friend to stay at this hotel and the hotel being fab on its own. To take it to six stars we got upgraded to Club55 - feeling spoilt. ",20,1
283,"This Hotel has it ALL, restaurants, casino, night life in the hotel and if that is not enough everything else is within walking distance or jump on the MRT (Singapore’s Transit System) which also is a very short walk. The Hotel rooms all have views of either the beautiful Gardens By The Bay or City which has a beautiful Marina with Incredible skyline. The rooms are clean and the staff go above and beyond exceptional service.  Enjoyed and will return.",50,1
284,I was staying for two night in this hotel at tower 3. The Building was realy Great. But the room is realy nothing special for a 5 star hotel. In the.night we couldnt realy sleep becouse the noise from the car outside.we can hear all the noise from the street . The swimmingpool at the top roof was nice. Can see beautiful view all around.,50,1
285,"One of the best hotels I have stayed at in the world . World class service from the airport to our suite . Exceptional staff ; caring, thoughtful , helpful and always smiling !!!!!! Made our business trip that much more amazing",50,1
286,"The infinity pool, view of Singapore, location and amenities were great. Lots of restaurants to choose from. The room is a nice, standard hotel style.On the downside....if traveling with kids you are surrounded by people who are obsessed by taking selfies by the pool. If it's a hotel that's child free, I understand the culture. But people by the pool will get annoyed with children splashing around.There was a section of the pool which was an adult only zone which people did not read about! ",50,1
287,Amazing hotel to stay in! The staff are very friendly and the facilities are amazing! Spent most of my time at the infinity pool! Nice cocktails available and food. A bit expensive but to be expected to sinagpore! A must for any bucket list! ,40,1
288,Nice hotel overall with the pool that is wonderful! Casino and mall connected are awesome. The rooms and bathroom are of nice size but a bit dated. The room services was prompt and well priced. The gym is well appointed but the changes rooms are a bit small. Sauna and Spa are also small for the size of property and number of people attempting to use the facility when i was.,50,1
289,"We stayed at the marina bay for one night during our honeymoon. We paid for an upgrade so we were on a higher floor with a much better view of the marina. The rooms were lovely and clean with a great shower. We ate in the italian restaurant on the top floor called lavo. We had a mixed experience, some staff seemed nonchalant whereas others were more than happy to help and the food was good. We had breakfast in the al la carte restaurant on the ground floor which had an amazing selection available. We spent time in the infinity pool which was amazing. It was very busy though and not somewhere you’d go to relax! The hotel was very pricey but we had budgeted for this as part of our honeymoon experience.",40,1
290,"And what a stop! If you can afford it, do it, simple as. Yes it’s a tourist attraction and yes it’s massive as a hotel but you’ve stayed in one of the worlds most iconic hotels with the most amazing roof top pool. I read loads of the negative reviews, more for comedy value as the Marina Bay Sands is an experience, not good or bad, just an immersive experience.",40,1
291,"Had an incredible stay with Marina Bay Sands, love the infinity pool and a sip of the sling.Don’t forgot to go tie the rooftop for the great view of Singapore.Room is a bit expensive but you got what you paid for, worst spending time and money here ",50,1
292,"Stunning hotel, and of course the rooftop infinity pool. Beautiful views from the pool out over the city of Singapore especially at night. Rooms where spacious, and luxurious. Right in the heart of all the action, great place to stay",50,1
293,"After a long flight it was great to arrive at a hotel with smooth and quick check in. We opted for a city view double room, which was spacious along with a huge bed and blackout blinds, helpful for the jet lag! The infinity pool can only be accessed by hotel guests but at night it is packed and hard to find room to enjoy the Singapore skyline, luckily we could see it from our room. However, at 6am we had a whole section of the pool to ourselves to watch the sun come up, worth the early start and made our stay worthwhile, we would recommend a stay just for this. We also made use of the Rise restaurant breakfast which had a huge variety of food, both asian and western hot food along with pastries, fruit, cereal etc, and as Singapore prices go was worth the $45 per person.",50,1
294,"If in Singapore, stop by and tour this unusual hotel.  Heard the rooms are not worth the rates, but experience the view - buy a ticket.",40,1
295,"We had an amazing stay in an enormous family room with an incredible patio balcony overlooking Gardens by The Bay. Huge hotel, infinity pool is amazing & a must see. This was a wonderful treat from our Son & his partner for us all while staying in Singapore & it was an unforgettable experience.",50,1
296,Best in terms of everything.Great hospitalitySupportive staffBest quality roomsAmazing infinity poolHuge casinoHad best Indian food at Punjab grillEasy access to garden by the bay and cloud forestNd overall best fun experienceIf you plan a trip to Singapore must visit this place.,50,1
297,My partner and I went to the F1 in sept . We went up the lifts to the bar area to get a drink and ended up in the dinner queue . It was difficult to communicate what we wanted to do . In the end they sent us down stairs to buy a ticket for the viewing deck . This was amazing the views were breath taking . We found out the next day you can pay £20 use the ticket to go into the bar area and get a drink . I’m disappointed this wasn’t made clearer as that’s exactly what we would have done . ,50,0
298,"I was only staying here for 2 days but got myself a city view suite and i have to say it was well worth it.  Firstly , the hotel itself is huge and has access to the shopping mall through an underground tunnel.   The Gardens by the bay are just behind it and are a must to see the show in the evening.   The rooftop pool is fantastic and so unusual and wasnt too crowded when we were there.  Staff in the hotel are really good and friendly and helpful and its one thing that i really appreciated while travelling.  The breakfast consisted of a vast selection of various types of food covering almost all ethnicity.   I'd definitely go again.",30,1
299,"It was every thing perfect! The Pool, the hospitality! We enjoyed every day in Marina Bay Sands! The hotel was wonderfull, the pool and room rervices too. I want to come back to Singapor and Marina Bay too ",50,1
300,My daughter and I had High Tea at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.It was one of the best we have had .Not only do you get a tea master to marry up the perfect tea for what you are eating but the food is unlimited.The food was amazing and exceptional.The staff were wonderful and very according .A must if you love High Tea like we do.,50,1
301,"While in Singapore, stay only in marina if yiu want to enjoy Singapore. For a complete 360 view of singapore, this is the only place, Swimming pool, infinity pool, on roof top is a achitectural marvel. The restuarant, the jaccuzi, febulous.",50,1
302,"My 2nd time staying here, but this time it is more memorable. i decided since we stayed here for three nights, i should explore the whole aspects of this hotel. What I love about this place is the facilities MBS has to offer. My first time walking the bridge that connects to Gardens by the Bay and enjoying the view from top to see the lobby and facade of the hotels. What lacks the most from this place is a big supermarket, a movie place and bowling alley for non gamblers.",50,1
303,"Expensive but worth the money from the minute you step outside your arriving taxi to the minute you step back in the taxi on departure. Our suitcases were unloaded from the taxi, we were given a card to present at check in and luggage was whisked away and in our room on arrival. Check in was very quick all in all about 5 minutes (including queueing). We were given our room key and told about everything we needed to know for our stay. We were shown to our room and the attendant told us everything we needed to know about operating lights, curtains, air con etc. We had a premiere room on the 37th floor overlooking the Bay Gardens (as requested). The view was magnificent and we watched the super tree light display from our balcony. The room was of a really good size, light and airy. The bathroom was exceptional with large free standing bath which our 9yr old absolutely loved. There was a separate walk in shower and separate toilet. Everything about the hotel far exceeded our expectations. We visited the sky deck which offered great views over the city. The swimming pool was just something else and we spent an awful lot of time there from very early morning till 11 pm when it closed. I have never experienced such an amazing pool and probably never will again. The hotel is not cheap to stay in but well worth the extra $$$. We will definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Singapore, even if only for 1 night.",40,1
304,"My family and I (2A, 2K, 8 & 10yo) stayed at Marina Bay Sands on a stopover from Melbourne to Thailand. After staying at the Marriott Khao Lak innThailand (comfy couch to sit on, welcome drink, personalised service), check in here was a rude shock. Hardly anywhere to sit (some fancy thing in the lobby that you can only sit on part of and a security guard watches over the rest!!), a massive queue to check in and our room was not ready. When we got to the room it was just ok - looks dated and a previous guest has clearly been smoking in the toilet. Access cards didn’t work where they were supposed to and I was underwhelmed with the whole place, especially for the exorbitant price. But I guess we stayed there as it is such an iconic building. The Skypark is fabulous fun and the location is great but I certainly wouldn’t stay there again.",50,1
305,"I recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands over the Formula 1 weekend and several extra nights(9 in total) to look around Singapore. The room I had was a Premier Twin Garden View Room on the 20th Floor in Tower 2. The room was spacious, clean. and well fitted out. The service from check-in to check-out was friendly and efficient by every member of staff in all departments including concierge, restaurants and gift shop. I tried breakfast in Rise Restaurant one day but found it a bit impersonal due to its size. I opted for Spago on the roof of the hotel which I had tried the previous day which had a more cosy and personal feel and also the view. Most evenings I went to Spago as it was a Lounge and Bar. Spago had a fabulous atmosphere, great music, plenty of drinks choice and very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Having experienced Spago I could see why it was a very popular venue. It was a shame when it was time to leave the hotel, I would have no hesitation in staying at the hotel again and would gladly recommend it to anyone. It was well worth the experience.",30,1
306,"visited the Marina Bay sands to enjoy the mall and Casino. The casino is huge and there is lots of action either on the slots or the tables. I would highly recommend the Casino and if you are a visitor to Singapore, don't forget your passport as you will need it for entry.  ",50,1
307,"What can I say that hasnt been said about this hotel, its simply amazing. The rooms, the staff, the amenities, everything is what a 5 star hotel should be. Everytime I visit this place its always amazing, and all the amenities and everything is great but no matter how many times I take a dip in the swimming pool on the top, everytime its breath taking.",50,1
308,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for two days. I was able to book a room with a good view with the kind help of a person named Wangelin Sum. The hotel's view was fantastic and the pool was also great. Thanks to you, I made good memories.",50,1
309,"Had a suite here as a birthday present last year and have never stayed anywhere quite like this in my life. The infinity pool on the roof was incredible and as you'd expect for a hotel at this price, staff & amenities impeccable. Will 100% go again.",50,1
310,* Good to visit at twilight * Amazing view of skyline * Laser show with themed music in the fountain is worth waiting for* The ferry ride - Singapore by night - is a memorable experience * Getting off at Clarke quay and taking in the food options available is a wonderful feeling ,50,1
311,"I could have given another extra star for the marvel of property and the location, truly phenomenal. I was here for he Formula One weekend and stayed at tower 2. Hotel was busy so the check in took us time albeit we had booked a night before so we could checkin in the morning. The front desk team were just as courteous as they should be, what really impressed me was the house keeping, room service team who were all so quick to attend to when needed. Eg, on arrival I realised the hair dryer wasn't working and I was a little reluctant to call for it thinking they make take time as the check in was long, to my surprise the replacement came immediately, I loved it. We did dine around the restaurants and bars in the hotel, I would say it was a mix of good and not so good experience. The staffs at ce La vie weren't as good as the ones on the lobby level (forgot the name of outlet). Why ? because on the qualifying day we decided to be up in the bar instead of being on the track, so we chose to be in ce la vie, however on entering, the hostess told us that for us to find a table our minimum spend per person should be $250. My point is not about the dollar but what have they to offer on that amount. Well we decided to be at the bar and not take a table, as the menu was presented I realised there was nothing for me to order as items were few and not service was slow.Whereas the common dining area for breakfast and lunch downstairs in lobby level had great food and service too. So perhaps my conclusion for today should be a second visit to add that missing star.",50,1
312,"I didn't t stay at this hotel during my trip to Singapore, but i did visit , after my visit i wish i would have stayed there, The level of attention form the minute you entered till the time you left was spot on. It didn't matter if I stayed there or not, I still received a fantastic level of service form all he hotel staff that I came in contact with. The place is very big and of course a bit confusing, but there were enough staff on hand to direct, ask and smile me to my destination. Much thanks for the warm treatment, I will defiantly choose there to stay on my best trip.",40,1
313,"We recently stayed for 7 nights in Singapore and we spent our final night at Marina Bay Sands hotel. We are a family of 5, two adults and three children and so I booked two adjoining non-smoking rooms for one night. This was a surprise for our children and it turned out to be a huge surprise for us too, as we were upgraded to a suite! We arrived at the hotel and I liked the way they have various staff in the foyer to greet people and direct you. It's such a popular destination that it's great that someone speaks to you personally and directs you to the correct places. We queued for a few minutes and then we were helped by a lovely lady- I'm sorry to say that I can't quite recall her name but I believe it was Ai Lee or similar (apologies for not recording this accurately). She explained that we could enjoy the pool area while they prepared our rooms and she said we may be fortunate to have even nicer rooms than we had organised. She was professional, polite and helpful.We were happy to enjoy the pool! We knew it was going to be full of people taking photos and selfies, but who can blame them? (Plus it's kind of fun to watch all the posing!) The view is magnificent and the architecture and design is stunning. We took some photos and swam, enjoyed the hot tub and ate fries by the pool. It was great! At 4.30pm we headed back to reception and we spoke to a gentleman before queuing and he directed us straight to a seating area where we were looked after by Maria. She was also very professional, friendly and helpful and she told us that we had been upgraded to a suite. We were stunned and very excited. Gideon escorted us in the lift to the 51st floor and showed us through our two bedroom (plus three bathrooms, balconies, living room, dining room, gym room, massage and hair dressing area!) suite which was amazing, We have never experienced anything like it. Our suite overlooked the Gardens By the Bay and we enjoyed watching the super trees light up later in the evening. The foyer on the other side near the lifts had a view over the marina and we sat there too to watch the light show.Our suite was way beyond our expectations and we loved the pool too. We ate our dinner beside the pool, ordering from the pool menu and we were really well looked after.Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was incredible and we would love to return and stay again. Truly unforgettable.",40,1
314,My colleague and here stayed here for one night after our conference at MBS. It was everything we could imagine and more! The breakfast at Adrift was amazing with a large variety. The infinity pool is beautiful and I loved the fact there was an adult only section. I wish there were more jacuzzis though.,50,1
315,"I stayed here with my wife for 1 night in September 2018.I booked a Queen room originally.  Check in was from 3pm, but we arrived at 1pm, and went to the Sands Lounge, where we took a ticket and drank free tea/coffee until our number was called.The check in clerk offered me an upgrade, and I took it.  It was worth every penny when my wife opened the door to suite 2406.  The suite had two rooms, bay views from both rooms, huge bed and bathroom, as well as a dressing room.In room there was a nespresso machine, kettle and tea / coffee.The staff were helpful and pleasant, snd even though my birthday was 9 days away, they noted the date from my check-in information and sent birthday cake to my room!!The skypark was a nice place to relax and people-watch, although drinks are expensive compared to downtown.  At night the views from the infinity pool are spectacular and not to be missed.It's a special place, and they make you feel special, so pay the money and treat yourself.",50,1
316,"Marina Bay Sands is the most luxurious hotel of Singapore, I believe. But every penny that you spend for it is worth. It's so so so beautiful. Super famous for it's infinity pool, no doubt you'll have infinite memories of the infinity pool  POINTS TO NOTE- 1. No mandatory swimming costume in the pool. You can chill in our swimwear or in anything you're comfortable with. The pool is open from 7am to 11pm. Chilling in the pool in the evening , watching the skyhigh buildings and the citylights  is a visual treat. They have drinks by the pool. And complimentary towels.Also, there are 3 to 4 Jacuzzi.2. There is an observation deck on 57th floor from where you get the view of Singapore. It's free when you stay in the hotel. Also, you can skip the Singapore flyer if you've been to the skypark observation deck.3. There is a mall right infront of the hotel having a metro station connected (The metro station is Bayfront and has connectivity all around)4. There's a casino in the mall, wherein entry for non-residents is free. You just need to carry your passport. 5. The opposite exit of the mall opens to the very fancy Helix bridge where you can take a walk. There's a hawker selling icecreams. That's a must try.Obviously there was a wholesome breakfast, all things fancy. The room was super pretty. The hotel staff were really welcoming. So so so worth staying here.",50,1
317,"We stayed here on our way to Thailand for 1 night. This hotel is stunning! It’s one of the iconic hotels of the world, a must see for everyone. Right in the heart of it all, shopping, restaurants, gardens by the bay, marina the list goes on. The rooms are massive with big bathrooms. We had a view of the gardens by the bay which are beautiful. There’s so much to see and do here! Only one thing we wasn’t to happy about, that was the beds. Ours was rather hard and not very comfy. But other then that what a hotel! ",50,1
318,"This is hotel is far from being a luxury one and feels more like a classic tourist trap.Off course the building where it is, is one of the most incredible  buildings of the world, great location, etc, etc...But from a hospitality perspective this hotel fails big time. Summary below:1) It is overcrowded....you need to queue for the breakfast, for the checking, for the lift, etc....2) It is 0 classy, it resembles more to a Carnival cruise experience rather than to a luxury exclusive resort.3) The pool is incredible, but good luck finding a bed, none cleans and takes the towels so its a mess, good luck finding a waitress to take your order, etc...4) I arrive to my room and the carpet was wet in multiple spots, kind of disgusting, they didnt care on apologizing, and send just housekeeping to try to solve the problem, which they did not. On the checkout i mentioned the issue when they asked ""How was your stay?"" and they even care to provide a solid apology.This is the stereotype of a pricey hotel for the mass market who can affoard it, it IS NOT A LUXURY property (if you being in Dubai think like the Atlantis type of crowd).My bottom line is, go ONLY if you want very hard to go into that amazing (but croweded) pool. Otherwise there are 5 better hotels in Singapore for the same price.",40,1
319,"Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was truly magical. We have stayed in many beautiful hotels around the world before, but MBS was by far the best. We stayed in a Premium room, in the middle tower, with a beautiful views of the Gardens by the Bay, Domes and Super Trees. We arrived in Singapore with 3 hours delay, around 9pm and the reception, at that time, was very quiet and our check in went quickly and smoothly. The receptionist was very nice and gave us all the necessary information, so we did not feel lost in this huge complex. After refreshing, in our beautiful bathroom, we went across to the Shoppes, and had a dinner at one of many restaurants. In the morning our first stop was, of course,  the famous Infinity Pool. It was truly magnificent. As it was still early and rather cloudy there were very few people there. We were able to take photos without crowds around, and all the best sun chairs were available for picking. The views from the pool were breathtaking, and with few people around it felt magical. We had a breakfast by the pool delivered from the Spago restaurant. I had 3 beautiful pastries and a coffee, and my daughter had a Bento Tray. Each day the pastries were different but equally yummy. Our room was on the 19th floor and it was connected by a walkway from the lifts area.  We could look down to the lobby from the walkway and take amazing photos. The room was spacious and beautifully furnished. Beds and pillows were super comfortable. Bathroom was specious and clean to perfection, as was the bedroom.Having free access to the viewing area as well as discounts at the bars and restaurants were truly appreciated. There is so much to do and see around the hotel 3 days were just not enough.  Next time in Singapore we will definitely stay at the MBS again.",30,1
320,So this a review from someone who normally stays in simple accommodation but for our silver wedding anniversary we splashed out on 2 nights at MBS - best decision we made. We checked in early and our room was ready - a deluxe room on 25th floor of tower 3 with a magnificent view over the gardens at the bay.  We of course got changed and headed straight up to the infinity pool which was as amazing as all the pictures portray. We were fascinated by the extreme measures taken for the perfect pose. We decided to treat ourselves to in room dining as we had such a magnificent view from our balcony. We had prawn and mango salad and smoked duck starter- both tasted fabulous and really big portions. For main we had fillet steak and rack of lamb again cooked to perfection. We had our meal while watching the gardens at the bay light show.I was slightly nervous staying here in case it was a bit pretentious - but it wasn’t.If you get the chance I would recommend staying here even if just for 1 night - it was an amazing experience.,50,1
321,"You are looking for sensation. You are looking for Comfort. You want to have the one time life experience. If yes, spend at least one night at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. I have stayed recently for 4 nights and have stayed before 1 night and every time it is magic. The design of the place is unbelievable. The view from the rooms is mind blowing. The facilities from the extra donate infinity pool until the shopping mall are amazing. It is just missing a bit of soul to make it as a perfection. Thank ou for the great stay.",50,1
322,Checking in was pretty quick and hassle free on this occasion. We were offered a room on the 17th floor of Tower 1 with a city view. The room was spacious and well lit. Liked the firm mattress and pillows provided. These really helped in ensuring a good night's sleep. The view from the room was awesome. We could see the city skyline and some of the other iconic structures clearly from the room. Really enjoyed this recent staycation.,40,1
323,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location close to parks, restaurants and high end shopping.  It is a very large hotel with some 2000 rooms and so breakfast is served in any one of 4 restaurant on the property but the pick for me was the roof top restaurant with magnificent views of Singapore. Whilst on breakfast, it was a full buffet with the addition of custom made eggs by the chefs on hand.  A good variety of fruits, cereal, juices as well as Asian and Western breakfast offerings.For such a large hotel the service was superb but a quick note, if you plan on staying in a club room be aware that the size of the club room is a little disproportionate to the size of the hotel so you need to be there early to get a seat or wait until a table is ready.That said, the food and drinks at the club lounge were excellent and of high quality.The hotel also has a well equiped gym with change room facilities as well as a separate male/female sauna, steam room and spa.The hero of the hotel is however the roof top pool and facilities.  The view from the pool is spectacular and the enough lounge chairs to cater for guests.  Complimentary towels are also provided and they even have photographers in the pool who can take your photos with either their or your camera.The pool area is divided into adults only and a separate children's area so the hotel caters for couples as well as families.",40,1
324,"My (now) fiancé and I stayed here in July 2018. We had planned to stay in a different hotel but he was planning to propose in the Gardens by the Bay and splurged for us to spend a single night at the famous Marina Bay Sands. This hotel is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at in my life and the experience was truly magical.After waiting in line to check in for about 30 minutes, our room was ready ahead of schedule and was immaculately clean and huge. We had a city view room on the 42nd floor. Our belongings were taken up to our room promptly and we left to explore the property and take a swim in the amazing infinity pool.The pool is exactly how you imagine it - it is clean and cool and packed with people but the view and the experience is amazing. Our pictures may be cliché but being in this famous pool was awesome and I'll never forget it.All I knew was that we had plans at the upscale C'est La Vie so we changed into our finest clothes and walked out to the Gardens by the Bay where my (now) fiancé proposed and had a professional photographer waiting for the moment. We had a small photoshoot around the grounds at the Gardens with the beautiful MBS in the background.Our dinner at C'est La Vie was delicious and they had reserved one of the best seats in the house for us. We had delicious food and even more delicious dessert. My only complaint was that the service was a little slow (but this seems to be the norm in countries other than the US) and we might have only noticed as we were excited for our friends and family in the US to wake up so we could share our news.When we got back to the room, our room was decked out in rose petals and had towel swans. It was cliché in the best way and I loved it. As for the bed, it was a little hard (most of the beds we slept in in Asia were more firm than we're used to) but otherwise we slept comfortably. The bathroom was immaculate and the amenities were very upscale (I usually don't bother to take hotel shampoo but this stuff was actually worth taking with you).Hands down this was one of the best hotels I've ever been fortunate enough to stay in and if the price is right for you, I highly recommend the whole experience.",50,1
325,The very aura of marina bay sand fills you with joy. The seaside view and food vendors make it the best place to stay and hangout. It is the main attraction of Singapore if you ask me. I would totally recommend staying there.,30,1
326,"We stayed for one night before flying back home from a fantastic holiday. This hotel is out of this world. The staff are so friendly and helpful and as we booked a club room we had to check in at the Sands Lounge which was effortless. We were checked in by a lovely lady who was friendly and interested in our holiday and travels. Our room was amazing, we were upgraded to a city view and it was a great view from our room. There was everything we needed and wanted. The one complaint I would have if I am being picky is the bath towels were quite small and rough feeling. The infinity pool speaks for itself. The water was warm, we went up before sunset and stayed until it was dark to see the city come alive. I have heard that weekends are particularly busy, but as it was a weekday it was plenty of room around the pool, sun beds and hot tubs. We visited the Club 55 for evening drinks and canapés as part of the booking and experienced great food, views and friendly service with staff who were again happy to chat and get to know you. We used the express check out which was so easy. Overall luxury on a grand scale with service to be proud of. ",50,1
327,one of the best hotels of the world it is a life experience an architectonik wonder inside and outside three separate buildings joined on the top with a huge rooftop on the rooftop there are restaurants gardens with trees waters and of course the infinity pool only for the residents you MUST swimm in this pool with the breathtaken view the lobby is fantastic the rooms are huge and nice in the evening they have a light show inside the sea unique the staff is like a very good mashine everybody knows very well what to do yes you have to go there,50,1
328,"This truly is a jaw dropping hotel with the most amazing views, We have just returned to the uk after been in Singapore for 10 days to take in the F1 and we wasn't disappointed. The hotel staff and Singaporeans in general are the kindest friendliest people i have ever encountered, Nothing is too much trouble. Even the locals are amazing, If you look lost they approach you to ask if you need help. We were slightly confused while using the MRT underground transport system and got on the wrong train, When I asked a passenger if i was on the correct train he said no come with me I will show you which one you need, He stepped off and missed his train to show us the right way, We couldn't believe it can you imagine that happening in London. The Italian restaurant on the 57th floor is were me and the Mrs celebrated my 50th and we had a cracking evening, Expect to pay through the nose for your meal and drinks tho, the price of a bottle of wine works out at about £70 and they add a service charge and tax which added another £80 to the bill, which is probably why they tell you not to tip. Another slight niggle is the observation deck, it has breath taking views but it seems that everyone sits all around the sides blocking you from approaching the sides to take a picture. We had to just try nudging in without upsetting anyone.Also once you enter the bar that is up there you cant exit back onto the observation desk for some reason or other. After been treated by some of the friendliest hotel staff while staying in the marine bay sands this bar is worth giving a miss. We are far from been snobbish but the staff are totally different in this bar, I think its because its also used by non hotel residents, But the service is shocking and all the time we kept thinking we wish we hadn't bothered calling in as it slightly tarnished what has been an amazing experience. The light show out side the marine bay shopping center is well worth watching but get there early as the 21.00 and 22.00 shows are very popular, Dallas bar was my favorite place to view and unlike a lot of bars they do contact-less which seems to be in its infancy in Singapore.",50,1
329,"We have just returned from a Singapore where we had 2 nights at the Marina Bay Sands. This hotel is amazing from outside. and takes your breath away at night. So lets start from the beginning, i have a broken foot and currently i have to wear a air cast. We arrive at reception to check into our Suite, well we queued for 40 mins mins before someone noticed that i had a broken foot, and ushered us to another area to be checked it. The queues at check in are very bad. It was only on my departure i was told that as i had booked a suite i could have checked in at the Sands Lounge ! The suite was amazing, very high quality to go along with the high price. The roof top pool was interesting, I appreciated it as the weekend but it felt like half of Singapore was in the pool. And why is the water so dam cold ???? The restaurants are very good, and the breakfast options are amazing. The hotel has a feel of a shopping centre downstairs and lacks any kind of exclusivity feel. Finally to be told it would take 30 mins for someone to come and collect our luggage and we would have to wait for someone to collect is not good enough, we had a plane to catch so we carried our own luggage down to check out and i havde a broken foot",50,1
330,"Marina Bay Sands is a massive project with 3 towers to begin with and has a convention center, casino, a theatre plus huge number of shops all connected together.  Its highlight is the infinity pool on the top floor that offers a majestic view of the Singapore skyline.  The rooms are quite roomy and modern so you either get a city or a garden view (Garden by the Bay).  Probably its because we stayed on a weekend which explains the pool is filled with so many hotel guests that it just feels crowded.  The lobby was likewise filled with people considering the huge floor area  the lobby covers which makes us wonder if the price per night the hotel charges is actually worth it or not.  It just doesn't give you that luxury or exclusive feel to an expensive hotel.",40,1
331,"We loved this hotel! Arriving from Europe after a long haul flight this hotel was an amazing antidote  for jetlag.We arrived at 9am and were able to check into our room immediately. Staff are extremely efficient and accommodating.  We had  a Premier Room which was spacious,luxurious  and ever so comfortable. Great view of the gardens (and lightshow) and the bay. The rooftop pool is an amazing and relaxing experience.",40,1
332,"The building is very beautiful and surprisingly. The room is very beautiful, very big and very modern. The views from the room was amazing, and the experience of being in the highest swimming pool of the world is impressive. See the sunset and how the buildings are being illuminating is very beautiful. The swimming pool is very large and there are some zones. Also, on the top there are some restaurants. The hotel is very well connected with underground, there are a lot of shops. If you go to Singapore, you have to stay at that hotel. We never forget this experience. I recommend you. ",50,1
333,Visited the Skypark in the day and at night. Night time was amazing and not to be missed. Incredible.,50,1
334,Breath taking hotel!!! From arrival with amazing staff despite it being a huge property to the rooms with magnificent view of the Bay and personal attention by the staff!!! Restaurants and bars are multiple and very good from Ce la vie on the roof top to the lobby bar!!!! The infinity pool on the roof is an experience that cants be missed!!!!! ,50,1
335,"This is definitely a unique place, the largest real estate investment ever, an ambitious architecture, THE Singapore landmark. My Deluxe room was really nice, very spacious and confortable. As I was in medium floor (26/F) my balcony was nice, with view on the garden. Amazing sunset ! However what I dislike is the massive scale of this hotel in terms of number of rooms and customers.... indeed it's more exhausting than relaxing giving the long distances to walk through, the queues, the crowd. Fortunately the staff is kind and really nice. I recommend just as a one-off experience.",50,1
336,I had stayed here for 1 night because it’s located near Marina Bay Cruise. A room is clean and hygiene. A view from my room is Garden by the bays so I can see the night show in my private zone !!! And swimming pool locate on rooftop and look like infinity pool!! ,40,1
337,"Well, I'm still in two minds about it. I mean yes, the pool with that view is amazing.The building is amazing.But, the poolside is crowded. Nowhere to put your things if all the loungers are taken. Too many vain people taking selfies (a couple of pics is acceptable but more than this becomes annoying). Showers in the rooms are pathetic. The view from my room was amazing and the bed was comfy. The check-in was sooo slow. Please do something about that. Long long walk to the food court.In all, would I stay there again? Yes probably. Not perfect but overall I enjoyed it.",40,0
338,"The hotel is iconic and you can't help but want to take pictures of it from every angle. But it is big and busy and not very welcoming. The room was big and beautiful, balcony huge with a view over the gardens by the bay. Location is great. Infinity pool looks dirty brown rather than bright blue, is busy and full of posers taking selfies with the view. And actually the view is quite bland as you are on the most iconic building in the skyline. We stayed at The Face Suites in Kuala Lumpur on the same holiday and much preferred the pool there and it was a fraction of the price! Glad we've stayed there but wouldn't go back. It's too expensive for what you get and if you want a pool holiday I'd go elsewhere!",40,1
339,"This hotel is very big very crowdy anf much to expensive for what you get,.We stayed in a beautiful room with great views but the drain in the shower was broken and the infinity pool was very very dirty.also the stuff is not friendly and not very helpfuland we had to wait long time to check in and check out",40,1
340,"I booked this hotel for 1 Night - Honeymoon.Upon arrival our luggage was taken from us and we went to the queto check-in. This took forever and there was only 4/5 people infant of us. This could have been a lot more better for a world class hotel which charges a lot of money per room. Was expecting better.The skypark was amazing - great views of the gardens and city skyline. We had breakfast at the hotel the next day. Breakfast was great! loads of foods of choose from.We didn't get a chance to visit the infinity pool - it was mega busy so if your looking for a quiet hotel, do not come here. If you want the tourist feeling of buzzing - highly recommended. I book the city skyline view. it was impressive. the room was clean and tidy - very spacious. We had a nice honeymoon cake delivered to our bedroom - which was nice. Nice hotel and good views.",30,1
341,We had been to Marina Bay Sands hotel Singapore for a conference. The stay was for just 2 nights but had a great time. Excellent view of complete Singapore city from the terrace. The infinity pool was simply great. Its amazingly made architecture. Growing trees on 70th floor itself is a wonder.,40,1
342,"Stayed here for the F1 and The following week for sight seeing. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. We landed at Singapore at 05:30 local time after a 13 hour flight. We arrived at the hotel by 07:00, tired but looking to leave our luggage whilst we looked around waiting for check-in at.15:00. Instead the staff checked the available rooms found one already available and checked us in there and then. Meant we could have a couple of hours sleep, freshen up and then have the rest of the day exploring the beautiful gardens around the hotelAs mentioned in the title, the hotel is iconic. The infinity pool on the top floor is a lot of fun, and the views are amazing, plus where else can you swim out doors on the 57th floor  in a thunder storm looking down on the whole of Singapore. And whilst the pool will never be empty, there is always space, plus on the Garden side of the hotel there are a number of  jacuzzis where you can just sit and enjoy a cocktail. Do note though it is not a pool for trying to swim lengths.  The observation deck on the same floor as rhe swimming pool is also a must. Great views across al of Singapore and even as far as Malaysia. Especially great is the evening light and music show in the Marina Bay.Mentioned how helpful and friendly the staff were. This was especially true of the room service staff. Every morning we had breakfast in the room. The food always arrived on schedule and the staff would chat about what we had planned and had already done, giving tips on what to do, what to avoid and how to get around.Other good bits. We enjoyed Lavo, an Italian restaurant on the 57th floor, most times, but see notes later on. The other restaurant to try is the buffet on the ground floor, that really is a must. Location wise the hotel is perfect for Singapore’s famous gardens, being just a bridge walk away. It is opposite the downtown area, perfect for boat trips around the Marina and river. The MRT station is located below Tower 1 of the hotel and Chinatown and Little India are both just a couple of stops away. As an added bonus, use of both the room safe and WiFi are free, though, for the WiFi, you do have to reconnect every 24 hours, complementary water supplied every day, and the free tea was replenished daily.That’s the good bits, and they are good. The bits that could have been better.  There is a mini bar in the room, but no space for your own drinks, etc, so no means of cooling your drinking water, or keeping milk in the room if you like milk with your tea/coffee.The air conditioning was OK, but it was difficult the get the room down to 21c at night.The restaurants in the hotel that we tried were fine, until the Conferences started up the week following the F1. At that point the staff were just overwhelmed and the places crowded.Finally, if you book direct with the hotel, breakfast is free. If not they will charge S$53 per person per day. Room service breakfast works out at around S$20 - 25 per day.",50,1
343,"We have just had a trip of a lifetime at the Marina Bay Sands, service was impeccable, staff friendly and helpful. Views from our suite were stupendous. Walked into tower one and it was fabulous. We were taken up to the suite to check in and they came to the suite to check us out, certainly the way to go. Beautiful place to stay and highly recommend it. When it's lit up at night, has to been seen to be believed! We pushed the boat out and had a two bedroom suite for our family, quite expensive but it was a once in a life time experience. The view over the bay was magical, the infinity pool was a lot busier than expected but still a great place to watch the sun go down. If only I'd remembered the Grand Prix I'd have booked it for later in the year but didn't. Which was my only regret  The service we received was exactly what you'd expect of a 5* hotel and definitely recommend it. We had fresh fruit in our room daily, they even baked a cake for my birthday and it was Gluten free so my wife and son could enjoy it too! Would love to go back.",40,1
344,Its such a wonderful view of Singapore town at night i.e good views as you walk along the street. There is plenty of eateries and art museum. The Formula one Singapore Grand Prix track is visible and attracts one of the largest crowds.,50,1
345,"Stayed here for 1 night, rave night of the F1 as a treat.Walked in to Tower 1 and was blown away.  As beautiful inside as it is outside.  No queue at check in so was spoken to by a very friendly member of staff who seemed interested in why we were in Singapore.“Would you like a free upgrade to a city view room Sir?”  Eh let me think about that. On race weekend, yes please!!Floor 32 with a view over the city.  Well worth the price I paid.  The room was perfect.  Plenty of room with a floor to ceiling window and a couple of chairs in front of it to watch the world go by.The bathroom was just amazing.  Massive bath, seperate shower wet room and another similar room for the toilet.Bed was super comfy and probably the best night sleep I have ever had in a hotel.Then comes the Roof top pool and viewing area.  Again, wow!!!!!!  I could have stayed in the pool all day watching the world go by.For breakfast, we decided to go to the roof again and had the best buffet breakfast ever.  Everything from fruits, cold meats and cheeses to hot food and French toast.  Everything tasted amazing!!One thing I noticed is that every single member of staff I saw during my stay, said hello and smiled.  A small thing which was noticed and went a long way.Yes this hotel is expensive, but you pay formwhat you get.  It was wlrth every single penny and I will certainly be staying there again.Thank you for a memorable stay which was the cherry on the F1 weekend cake!You wanted to make the best hotel in Singapore.  Well you have!!  Do not change what you are doing.",50,1
346,"I stayed at MBS a few years ago and loved it, we were upgraded to a suite as we stayed on a Monday night which was a treat and the hotel is so big it has that real wow factor when you walk in.Sadly, it felt that this time around the size of the hotel is what was bringing it down. It's now so big and knows it will always have clients due to its famous infinity pool that it doesn't bother too much with that 'above and beyond' service you would expect from such a famous (and non-cheap) hotel.MBS has a lot of mixed reviews for a reason...Check in was ghastly, it took over 45 minutes and was eating into our pool time which was not cool. There was a big challenge over rooms as my friend was also staying and we were wanting to be on the same floor, long story short I paid more money than my friend for the same room as them which was far from great.The rooms felt a bit outdated with the furniture and there was nothing quirky or wow about them. Big bathroom with a bath but the shower is just sort of squeezed in next to it and it's quite enclosed so not much ambience if you fancy a soak. Our friend's room has some extra furniture it which didn't make much sense and both balconies only had one seat on them. I've read on other reviews you can request another chair but why would you need to? At a 5* resort, I would expect to be able to sit on the balcony with my Partner without having to call down first for an extra chair. When I stayed in the suite the balcony also left much to be desired with no working lighting and leaves all over it. However, a big plus was the balcony faced the Gardens by the Bay which was a delight. A complimentary mini cake was put in the room for my Partners birthday which was nice.For some real positives... there are bars and eateries aplenty in the hotel and with the adjoining shopping area, you have so much choice you will not be going hungry! The location is fantastic with easy access to the marina and the Gardens by the Bay (be sure to read separate reviews on these!). Renku bar in the lobby is really nice, quirky cocktails and the best complimentary truffle crips and nuts.But on to the real reason everyone visits MBS... The infinity pool!! The pool is huge and has those Instagram worthy views over the skyline. You can only access the pool if you are a hotel guest so you do need to pay to play here. They did decide to clean the pool from 4-5pm though meaning part of it was shut off which made no sense at all given how busy it is at that time. The pool stays open til 11pm though which is nice to see the views at night too.Upon check out, I mentioned the issue we had experienced on check in and the price difference for the same rooms and after another 30 mins spent talking to the concierge we were finally given some money off our food & beverage bill and a complimentary taxi to our onward destination. Nobody could explain the price difference to me and the total time listening to 3 different people try was excruciating and took away from the stay (my Partner and friend both didn't understand either so not just me!).Overall the service does not match what you would come to expect from a 5* star hotel, and as I have said before it's the little touches that really make a difference in the high-end hotels so without them it feels like you are just another number and your custom isn't really appreciated. Apart from the concierge who did try a bit, it seems this is the case at MBS. I would recommend a trip here just to experience the infinity pool but for everything else, there are much better places to stay and most of them for much less of the price. It would be great if MBS upped their game again to keep people wanting to come back rather than just paying a lot of money to swim in the pool.One of the rooftop restaurants in MBS called LAVO is worth several visits though and is free to go in, so you can see some of the views from the top floor without staying at the hotel - HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Separate review written on this glorious eatery.",50,1
347,"Dear Up_up_and_away2018,Thank you for your valuable feedback.I am disappointed to learn about the challenges that you encountered during your stay with us. Please rest assured that we will continually strive to enhance the quality of our offerings and service touch points in order to serve you better and I have shared your comments regarding your stay experience with the relevant departments for their review and attention. I have sent you a private message and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.",30,1
348,We went to the Marina Bay Sands for the view only we didn't stay. The most cost effective way to get to the top is to buy a ticket to the top floor bar. They are $SD20 each BUT include the cost towards some refreshments. Sure you can just pay the same amount to go to the viewing platform (which is one floor below) but you only get the admission. The bar area at least allows you to linger over a drink at a table (inside or out) and take in the view of Singapore and the rooftop infinity pool. These tickets are available from the LOBBY level and not lower ground floor). The views are extensive and by going to various points around the level you can get near 360 degrees views around this location.It is also quite disabled friendly as well (including disabled toilets). We didn't see the rooms but the lobby and reception area is truly massive with the interior space open nearly all the way to the roof.,50,1
349,"It’s expensive but really worth it.This hotel has smoking rooms and smoking areas. It is directly connected to its own shopping mall; has a skyview of almost all of the island; and, has a 100 meter swimming pool at the roofdeck 57th floor. A truly great experience!",40,1
350,"This is an incredible motel that was very high up on our bucket list. The building, the view, the pool and the sky deck are all incredible. However, the service is atrocious. It is extremely expense for food and drinks yet this is not matched with high quality, high class service. Right from a poor check in experience through to a poor checkout experience we were frustrated by poor communication, a lack of care or even low quality customer service. We discovered that despite staying for 3 nights you only receive free wifi for 24 hours. Even the cheapest motels offer free wifi now. To get free wifi after this you need to sign up to the rewards program. This was not explained at check in and the log in screen is very confusing. To join the rewards program you join a queue for an hour for the 1 staff member to process your application. We were charged for drinks from the mini bar that we did not consume. You can not change the temperature in the room and it is freezing. We asked for a blanket and was given a thin blanket that helped slightly so got a 2nd. The 2nd one was taken away after the 2nd night. As far as the Grand Prix goes you would not even know it was on if you couldn’t look across the bay to the Grand stand. We moved to the Novotel on the other side of the bay for the actual race weekend and it was like being in another country. They were embracing the race and everything that goes with it.My advice to anyone attending the Grand Prix stay on the opposite side of the bay from the Marina Bay Sands",50,1
351,"It is definitely a must stay hotel in Singapore since it has outstanding views and an amazing swimming pool.  Hotel is huge but sadly reception was not informative enough to let us know the places we should visit upon check-in since they are based in the hotel itself. Being unaware, we were not able to visit the sky view at the hotel since we needed to check out and only find out then. They did not allow us to go back upstairs which was a pity that ruins the experience.  Overall the rooms were very clean had a good size. The swimming pool was amazing but it was almost so difficult to make an order or to receive food too.  I probably won't visit again, but it was once a lifetime experience and I ticked it !. Thank you Marina Bay Sands.",20,1
352,"It has been decades since I have been treated so badly by hotel staff. I turned up at the fitness center ready to use a treadmill. And I was turned away because I didn’t meet their “strict dress code”.  The woman at the counter questioned whether my pants were sufficiently athletic. I was told that my long sleeve shirt was not allowed. And I was barred from entry. The gym was completely typical, except for its view, and it was really quite humiliating, unnecessary and a waste of my time.  If you’re interested, you can check out my inappropriate shirt in the picture.For me this hotel was a poor value and a bad experience.I’ll add the good: at about usd 650/night, my 42nd floor premium room had a great view. And the pool on the 57th floor rooftop was even better.The room was otherwise about what one would expect for half the price. The bathtub was plastic, which was surprisingly  cheap. The air conditioning was noisy.The rooftop pool is populated almost completely with posers — literally everyone posing for selfies. It is fairly understandable. And unavoidable. You just need to be comfortable swimming or trying to relax in the middle of a tourist attraction. The staff were mostly polite in an autonomous mass market kind of way. And the cleaning staff were very conscientious.",30,1
353,The overall experience is great.We had met friendly staffs and approachable room attendants. They are very welcoming and pleasant. The infinity pool is quite crowded but it is the best part of our stay.,20,1
354,This is an iconic hotel that commands the status it seems to be asking for in the Singapore skyline. We booked an upgrade and got a city view room with access to the Club 55 which meant we had afternoon tea and then canapés and drinks between 5pm and 7pm. This upgrade was well worth it as it meant you could dine slightly more exclusively with amazing views of the city or Bay Gardens. The food was simply perfect and was so plentiful it meant that the two days we were there we didn’t need to eat anywhere else. The only real down side is that hotelIs so big it made the lobby area really busy with tourists and guests but that said the staff are so efficient that check in and check out was really quick. Be careful as this was the first stop on our honeymoon in the region and we weren’t aware of the taxes added to every bill. This meant that the final bill was over 20% more than we expected and 20% of a lot is a lot!! This is not just unique to MBS but the whole area. The hotel is situated at the opposite side of the bay to most of the other tourist areas but these areas can be accessed really easily using the MRT which is Singapore’s underground. There is a station under the hotel conveniently. We were there for two nights and didn’t need to venture far from the hotel because the views were so amazing and the choice of bars and restaurants were more than we could have needed. We would definitely return..... but may need to earn a few more pennies!!!,50,1
355,"had to stay 2 nights for business since it is closest to expo in mbs. i arrived 10am and was dropped off by grab in the third tower. i checked in and was greeted by the warm staff and was efficiently sent on my way up. i got a room on the 25th floor of tower 3 and immediately saw the space of the room. the toilet was complete with toiletries and had a luxurious feel. i was hoping that it had a tub and some rainfall type shower but it was functional nonetheless. the bed was equipped with soft pillows and clean sheets that made my sleep great. i particularly liked the balcony overlooking the gardens by the bay. had breakfast at rise and was really happy with the selection. i guess it is hard to have such a great image that sometimes you get compared to that all the time. the hotel is still a great hotel but i guess once you think that it is the icon in sg and it has a few things for improvement, you kinda get dissappointed a little bit. still, wonderful hotel and i will stay again in the future for sure",50,1
356,"Iconic hotel with shopping mall attached right at the front of the bay.  We went for the Grand Prix and a few extra nights and were delighted with this fantastic place.  The alternative food outlets had everything we needed and we didn't need to repeat any venue - though understand that they are expensive.  Our room was great, the staff were helpful, the place feels special, the views are amazing.  Our only complaint: the pool area was a big disappointment - far too crowded with a lot of people just standing in the pool eating and drinking. Poor guest behaviour (could be better managed) but frankly the pools are too small for the size of the hotel when it is full.",40,1
357,"We stayed three nights, and everything went without a hitch.  The room was big, and had a nice balcony and gorgeous bay view of the Singapore Gardens and Ships off shore.  The facilities are very nice, yet it’s a vibrant massive hotel with a Vegas or cruise atmosphere that my wife and I don’t prefer, so we did not use the famous infinity pool on top.  The food at breakfast was great and very varied, room service was outstanding and the fridge for Sin$10 for the whole stay was a classy touch.  The ladies who clean the rooms are always around to give you an extra bar of soap with a smile, Xiao Li seemed like the boss of our floor and although she was Chinese her English was much better than the concierge’s at another luxurious hotel we have stayed recently.  Xiao’s attitude was superb and allowed us to feel at home and well pampered.  The room service came quickly and they were never pushing for tip, so I wanted to Tip more.  My wife and I greatly enjoyed our stay and the hotel’s staff’s great service at this Singapore landmark!!",50,1
358,"Marina Bay Sands is an expensive property. But if you want absolute luxury you have to pay for it. And it is worth every penny. I would rank it as one of the best hotels in Asia if not the world. Its an experience worth paying 300-400 USD a night even for the basic rooms. Sunrise at the infinity pool when its next to empty more than makes up for what you pay for the room. Everything else is a bonus.Check In - The smoothest experience I have had in any hotel across the globe. Standard check in time is 3 pm. We reached there around 1. There was a small queue and staff was serving juice to those waiting in line. We expected to be made to wait till the check in time. But even before we said anything the lady at the reception gave us our room keys and said we can't make you when you have a 3 year old child. Super impressive and attentive service. They gave us a room on the mid 30s floor (apparently the highest they could offer us for the room category since it was my wife's birthday). Luggage arrived at the room in about 15 minutes of us checking in.Room - We got a garden view room and were quite the happy for it. 30 plus floors meant that we got a good view of everything around us. And the cherry on the cake was that we could see the entire Gardens By the Bay light show in the evening from our room balcony itself. Rooms were of a good size (balconies not so big) and huge compared to the rest of the Singapore hotels. All modern amenities included though they could do better with the channels being offered on the TV (if you want to watch TV in a property like this). Infinity Pool - Perched atop 57 floors with all three towers joined together, the Infinity Pool at MBS is a tourist attraction in itself. We went there in the afternoon after checking in and it was swarmed with hotel guests as well as other guests who had paid just to use the pool. We managed to get pool chairs but there was hardly any space in any of the pools. We returned the next morning before sunrise and it was so worth getting up early. The view was fantastic. There was hardly anyone there and we were able to take pictures to our heart's fill. The lifeguard was also kind enough to take some pictures of us together. Post sunrise the pool started filling up but by then we had had our fill of the pool and moved to the family jacuzzi on the other side. Our son also loved the kid's pool which is at one end of the infinity pool - completely cordoned off and safe enough for us to let him play around on his own.  Breakfast - There are 3 restaurants serving morning breakfast to the hotel guests. You can use any of them - we decided to use the one on the ground floor next to the reception - it was the biggest and with the largest variety. Note that all the restaurants have different timings and after 9 am there are also boards outside which state the waiting time - and it can get upto 30 minutes waiting especially towards the en dof breakfast. The food spread was extensive with various sections. The best part - there were enough vegetarian options (Indian as well as continental) and everything was well labelled so we didn't have to ask anyone. If we had stayed another night we would have tried out the breakfast in the restaurant next to the infinity pool.  Service - A birthday cake was sent to our room for my wife's big day in the afternoon. In the evening he returned with another cake which we returned. The cake tasted delicious though and on hindsight we should have kept the second one too. Service at breakfast was prompt too despite the crowds. Check out was super smooth as well. A hotel staff met us while we were standing in line with an I-Pad. He asked us if we had used anything from the mini bar or if there were any other billables. When we said no, he checked us out on the spot and saved us the agony of standing in line. There are also options to check out online, or using the TV, or by using a drop box form. Other Attractions - Of course you start with the casino which is open 24/7 and spread over 3 floors. There is also a complete mall in the underground floors below the reception which house just about every luxury brand you can think of. Quite a few celebrity chef restaurants as well as a huge food court. So plenty to do - you can actually blow up as much money here as you want.Overall - Undoubtedly one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in. Pure luxury and indulgence. Definitely a must do if you are going to Singapore even if you can only afford a single night stay.",50,1
359,"Stayed many times at MBS, mostly for quick getaway, and surprisingly their service is consistently good. Had a bit of problem with the bathroom but got fixed within 15 minutes. The hotel is super crowded as usual.",50,1
360,"Stayed here for 5 nights for the formula 1. Stayed in a deluxe city view room on level 40. Yeh the view is nice , but for the price we paid we did expect a lot more. The shower is big but the shower head and pressure was terrible. The lifts are hot and uncomfortable. The bed is not very comfortable. Seemed to be very tight with the amenities that were sometimes not replenished. It is handy to stay there as trains are close but would definitely stay somewhere else if we ever return for the Grand Prix.",50,1

362,"A hotel with a bit of class.  Wanted something a little special for our last couple of days in this beautiful city and that’s exactly what we got.  Beautiful room overlooking a beautiful garden view.Had a relaxing time by the infinity pool and a cool off in the pool and enjoyed a couple of cold drinks.Great buffet breakfast this morning, not included and a little pricey but worth it.",40,1
363,"This hotel really only survives because of the spectacular pool and rooftop. I can't imagine why anyone would stay here otherwise.The rooms are basic and over-priced. The location is okay, but not great, The ground floor area and lobby is a concrete monstrosity.Now I have stayed here and enjoyed the pool and roof, there is no way I would stay again - there are much nicer hotels in Singapore.",50,1
364,"Dear Nightwatchman,Thank you for your valued feedback. Though I am happy to note that you enjoyed your time spent at the Sands SkyPark infinity pool, I regret to learn that your stay with us was not a complete success.

Nevertheless, I look forward to welcoming you back in the near future to experience more of what our one-stop destination has to offer. ",30,1
365,Hotel was absolutely beautiful and extremely impressive as far as design and architecture goes. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. If you have a chance check out the infinity pool on top of the hotel. ,50,1
366,"Stayed for 1 night during business trip.Pluses:- it is just amazing place to be - incredible architecture and structure;- beautiful day and night view from infinity pool;- nice gym;- spacious well equipped rooms;- nice view on Marina and Gardens (have opposite option - but i like night Gardens view with light show);- super convenient around - shopping mall, convention and exhibition center, casino, concert hall and etc;- good breakfast with good selection.Minuses:- it is just so many people....... - check-in was long. Have to be optimized;- pool is a bit messy with so many people there day and night;- in general does not worth it i would say. - very loud in Gardens direction. Sound protection is not best. In general - maybe for special occasion worth it. But have many other better options in Singapore. ",50,1
367,Excellent restaurant and excellent friendly staff. Especially Celine who was the number 1 employee!The cover changes was 48$ but normally it is less and the view is worth every penny. Also you get a free drink with that so if you have a Baileys you probably break even,30,1
368,"This hotel is really something. It is absolutely huge. We stayed here for one night so that we could enjoy the views from the top and of course the iconic pool.We arrived at around 10am which meant check in was really quick and easy. Our room wasn’t ready but we were given temporary keys so that we could explore the hotel before our room number was allocated. This then meant we could quickly have the keys updated later on with our having to wait in the long check in queues.The hotel is in a great location with minutes walk to the MRT and gardens by the bay. The shopping mall is well worth a visit even if you aren’t planning on shopping. The room was large, clean and very comfortable with a fantastic view over the bay so we could see the light show from our room in the evening. The curtains open automatically when you enter the room so that you can enjoy the view. Minor issue, the shower head could do with a clean as water was spraying off in all directions so keep hitting me in the face which wasn’t so pleasant.The pool and view from the top is by far the best thing about this hotel. We spent some time here early afternoon and then went back for sunset. We were lucky enough to find sun beds with ease on both occasions in the adults area. Staff are very attentive and offer a drinks service to your sun bed. The Jacuzzi area over looking gardens is a lovely place to chill out and watch Singapore light up at night.",50,1
369,Stayed for a quick overnight stop F1 Grand Prix grand final night. There were road closures in place but this didn’t really affect us getting to the hotel by cab. We stayed in the Deluxe Garden view room. We had a great view of Gardens by the bay (we were up on the top floors). Room had a small view of pit lane from the balcony. We kept the door open so we could hear the cars racing but you wouldn’t know they were close if your door was closed.The hotel was very busy with racing spectators. Bars & restaurants upstairs were pretty much booked up. The room key system limits where you go in the hotel- aka only hotel guests are able to enter the pool area. This is great as it’s good to have some privileges if you are a guest! Pool gets cleaned at 6pm - swimmers must hop out. Takes about 10 mins We had room service as the menu was very broad but it was reasonably priced.Coffee shop downstairs gas coffees & desserts which can be taken to ur room.We had a wonderful experience.,50,1
370,"We stayed here in December 2017 for my wife's birthday, 5 nights.The room great .The service great.The staff above and beyond .Val and Lawrence in the dinning room ,you guys are the greatest.We so look forwards to coming back",50,1
371,"Went back to Singapore after living there for a short time 40 years ago.The changes were massive.We stayed at Marina Bay and from there we visited lots of places which was fantastic.The view from the top of the hotel was just fantastic, both at night and during the day.We also had dinner in the restaurant on top of the building overlooking the harbour.  Amazing.  So were the prices, but not something we do everyday.The rooms were spacious and very comfortable we had one overlooking the gardens which were quite stunning at night.We loved our time there, brought back some good memories",50,1
372,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights last week. We really enjoyed our time at this hotel. We felt like we were in Vegas! There was so much to do on or near the hotel grounds that you really didn’t need to leave. Location couldn’t be more perfect. Plenty of places to eat, shop, and sight see near by. The hotel was also extremely clean (which is personally very important to me). Hotel staff were nice and respectful as well. Areas for hotel improvement: 1. Check in line was ridiculously long 2. Guest celebrating special occasions should feel special when they choose to spend the occasion with you. Otherwise we had a pleasant experience and would recommend staying here to other guests. ",50,1
373,"Stayed in the Marina Bay Sands for the Singapore Formula 1 weekend. The obvious comments about the place would be it has a feel of the major hotels in Vegas - very big, slick and efficient.The hotel itself is an imposing structure and is almost iconic in the city (much like the Burj Al Arab in Dubai).My biggest praise I have for the place are to its staff. Always pleasant and smiling and nothing being too much trouble.We had a few issues that had been caused by our travel agents and the hotel staff handled it on our behalf with class and efficiency.They ensured our stay was not affected and went out of their way to rectify the situation even though it was not them that had caused it ... they even sent champagne and chocolates to our room as a gesture once it had been remedied.Top class hotel, staff, food and rooms - brilliant !!",40,1
374,"You must stay in the hotel at least one night to try to swim the the roof swimming poolPool is very big and the view is unbelievable Room is big with two types of view which are garden or bayBreakfast is not badNothing free in this hotel , even water need to pay ",50,0
375,"Spacious and  amazing hotel. Breafast was really great , all sorts of variety and delicios which it should be for what it costs to stay here..The bars and restaurants are great. The pool is amazing.The downfall is irs always crowded.Would i stay again , probably not , it was a once on a lifetime experience",40,1
376,"MBS, as it is affectionately called by locals is a stunning property with an iconic pool on level 57.  Said to be the largest pool in the southern hemisphere, this infinity pool offers sweeping views of the city.  If the property is out of your budget, do what many guests do, stay elsewhere for the bulk of your trip and finish with a couple of days here to finish your visit.This is a large hotel with about 3,000 rooms.  The standard rooms are perfectly adequate, modern, stylish and elegantly furnished, but you don't stay here for the rooms, it's all about the pool. Recommended. ",40,1
377,"Huge, well kept. Easy to get lost.So much going on. Like a hotel in Las Vegas. Well kept. Big. Busy with nice atmosphere. Canal boat ride, casino, coffee shops, restaurants and more. Plus the famous infinity pool only for hotel guests.",50,1
378,"We stayed here for one night in a deluxe room. This place is amazing. We are not used to staying at luxury hotels, so maybe other people who are used to this will have other opinions.Location: The hotel has a very good location. There is an MRT station underground. You can walk directly to Gardens by the bay and the shopping mall next to the hotel (there is a walkway that connects these places that goes trough the hotel).Room: The deluxe room with city view was one of the best rooms we have had in our travels. The curtains open themselves when you walk into the room! The bathroom is spacious (no bathtub).Pool: I think a lot of people obviously come here for the pool view. We stayed here for 3 hours to watch the sunset and nightlights come to life in the city. This was the highlight of our stay. The poolside chairs are quickly full, so try to get there early or don't take to much stuff with you to the pool.Prices: The prices were naturally higher than in any other hotel. We found it a bit expensive, but again, we are not used to luxury hotels.Hotel grounds: the shopping mall is worth a visit even if you don't plan on buying anything. This mall is beautifull and has a manmade river flowing through it.",50,1
379,"Really luxurious, spacious and classy rooms with a very big balcony overlooking the beautiful Gardens by the Bay! As soon we went to the lobby, we were flooded with the a lot of people! However it was overlooked because of the main attraction which was its infinity pool! We had attended the Halloween bash at the rooftop bar with an amazing view! What a great stay!",50,1
380,"Treated ourselves to a few nights in a king club room for a big birthday.On arrival, we were 3 hours before Check in, but our bags were whisked away so that we could get the process underway.We're given passes to begin enjoying the hotel facilities, and told we would receive an email when our room was ready.In less than half an hour we received the email, and were in the room.Fantastic, huge, comfortable, amazing.  Nesprsso Coffee machine with variety of choices, teas and a kettle. Tea is served in club 55 as part of the room price from 2-4.  Delicious! Every day the food items were different, and delicious.  You can have any soft beverage, not just tea!Then at 5-7 alcohol and soft drinks and canapes are served in club 55.  The food again, amazing.  Cheeses, fruit, hot and cold canapes.  Each time we went to club 55, the staff remembered us and they notice when your glass needs replenishing.Pool is of course amazing.  Split into 2 sections, one for adults only.   We never had a problem getting a Lounger.Breakfast for club 55 guests is in a choice of restaurants.   We chose spago near the pool.  Very efficient.  Eggs cooked to order, and brought to your table, and of course, a huge selection of delicious buffet style foods.Staff knew it was a big birthday, and a cake and candle had been delivered to our room at the turn down service.  Absolutely lovely!The staff are all so friendly and accommodating.  We were so glad we came.The only thing I can say for improvement ...  a few fittings in the bathroom were showing their age, but this does not take away from the 5 dot review for the stunning marina bay sands, I miss it so much!",50,1
381,We took a room at 53  floor for me my wife and 17th year old daughter.  We pay for three persons but the third bed was to small for an adult.We got a garden view room  the room was big clean .The view is one of a kind.We are breakfast at business lunch and it was very good. And very luxury. The pool is the most amazing pool in the world.Every thing was perfect it cost but its worth. The location is also in best place near every thing and near mt.Don't miss this hotel if you are in Singapore. ,50,1
382,"Beautiful hotel, lots of things to see and do close by. Taxi to and from airport was approx 18singapore dollars. Gorgeous view overlooking the gardens. Worth every cent. Hotel staff sent a beautiful anniversary cake to our room. Felt the love by all staff",50,1
383,Came here for a long weekend getaway with my wife to celebrate her birthday. It was a luxurious stay that was extremely relaxing and received excellent service from all staff.great views from the gym and infinity pool is as brilliant as depicted in photo's.,50,1
384,"This was a must try for us when visiting Singapore, upon arrival the lobby is huge and the  queue for check in was rather large and the lobby busy with mainly non guests. The room was lovely very big and bathroom was great. However, given the level of hotel and costs there are quite a few moans coming! Severe lack of tea and coffee facilities in the room, I know this is minor but you even get this in budget hotels. Water was on a severe shortage! we asked for more and didn't get it. I do think that they need to separate the paying hotel guests from the general public, it was like a circus most of the time and not relaxing in the general hotel areas. We went to the pool (one of the main attractions!) and yes we expected it to be busy but people trying to sell you photos and just non stop, defo not one if you want to go and relax! We used the gym which seemed to be well equipped although many of the treadmills weren't working, but good changing areas and surprisingly free water given the lack in the rooms!We ate in Lavo, where the service was very poor for the level and cost of the restaurant! Overall, yes its a tick the box exercise and we won't be going back, we will be sticking to the Mandarin Oriental in future!",50,1
385,"Decided to stay here after seeing Crazy Rich Asian movie, the infinity pool was the main reason we want to stay at this hotel. The rooms were clean and we had the view of downtown and the fountain light show. the restaurant specifically the service at spago and the pool area was excellent, very friendly and prompt. ",30,1
386,"Stayed here during our Singapore stay and it's been an overwhelming experience for the family. Situated in the City Centre with it's very own shopping malls, catering up to high end brands. Friendly staff, very busy check in counter (prepare at least 45 minutes to an hour). Make sure you know which tower you have booked into, as there are different check in counters on every tower (you wouldn't want to queue on a wrong counter). The Infinity pool is amazing, you really cannot swim as it's too crowded but enough space to dip in and take a selfie. This is really luxury!",50,1
387,Relax your dayWalk 10 kms to make ur pot go down by 1”Have fun around the park with nature and sunFew places to have a snack or a meal  Take water with you.  Make sure to watch the laser show and to enjoy the night,50,1
388,"Check in queue far too long - needs to be urgently addressed. As with other guests we were staying to experience the hype of the infinity pool - pool was great if very, very  busy - had to wait for beds near pool. Towels at pool great -.plenty and warm. Room service surprisingly good and efficient. Overall a one off hotel experience that’s a tick box. ",40,1
389,"you see this hotel from all around the city.  its 30$ to get to the top and you can only get to a small part you cannot get to the pool area, thats for guests only.   but its a great picture taking placethere is also a restaurant and bar ontop",40,1
390,"We took a family room for a couple of nights.  The room was very big, with two toilets and one shower room.  It also has a mini kitchen area (really only for coffees and other drinks), and a sofa.  It also had a massive balcony, but we didn't use it.  My only criticism of these rooms are that they are on the first couple of levels so if you do want to sit on the balcony you will get a lot of road noise.  Once the sliding doors are shut though, you hear nothing.  Beds were only ok - a little too hard, but that is better than them being too soft I suppose....But the hotel facilities, and restaurants are fantastic.  The roof top pool is obviously the focal point and whilst its impressive its probably not reason enough to stay here to be honest.  Its almost always crowded, and hard to get a deck chair on it.  We had a good short stay here and would stay again, but probably only on a discounted rate.",50,1
391,"MBS is a Singapore icon. Very fast and efficient service. But quite pricey. But good for a once/month night out. Excellent roof top bars, and weekends get very busy, so plan ahead. Building is a marvel.",50,1
392,"If you think you saw it all, first visit this hotel, from the moment you enter the hotel you get amazed with the grandiosity of it. From the roof top you get the most beautiful scenery of Singapore, located in the heart of Singapore.",40,1
393,"I don't understand why the ratings of MBS are dropping down.First of all we didnt have to wait a Q, the service was all well arranged so in only 10 minutes after arrival, we were accommodated in our beautiful room.The room was spacious, very clean and had a great view  (especially in the night) of the Shoppes and city.I combined my trip from Bali to Singapore just to go to Marina Bay Sands ( one of the main reasons) as it gave Singapore a symbol to identify with. (At least in my opinion)The infinity pool is just amazing and we visited during day and night and it was never crowded. Except great views to experience on top of 57 floors, we also took some great amazing photos there. From MBS we even didn't have to cross any roads because the shoppes and Gardens by the bay were all connected with underground passages.Great stay ! We loved it <3",50,1
394,"I can't stress enough how amazing these buildings are. There's a huge ship on the top with a pool overlooking all of Singapore. Don't forget to bring your swimsuit, and remember to order some of the delicious drinks up there.",50,1
395,"After visiting 8 countries in 8 weeks we felt a nice stop to relax in Singapore was a good idea. The visit to Singapore was great but staying at the Marina Bay Sands was not a good choice. It’s mostly ridiculously busy with people coming and going. Not a hotel to choose if you want to just chill out. The 3 restaurants were always full, the music blaring at breakfast (inappropriate music choice for dining) and would be great if there was a adults only area - just a break from children crying or having a tantrum. Holidayers who pay lots of dollars for a 5 Star Hotel would expect 5 star treatment which includes, accommodation, meals and general atmosphere.",50,1
396,"Sure, the Marina Bay Sands is spectacular from the outside already, and the pool indeed is a spectacular experience. So it is worth a visit and great fun, but once seen alternatives can be considered..Check-in is is organized, but due to the sheer size of the place it feels like an airport with mass processing. Once in the room things get better: Pleasant design and great views. Definitely worth to go for the higher rooms with city view. Then the roof-top pool: just great, particularly early in the morning before the crowds come in.In a nutshell, a fun and spectacular experience worth to see, however, if you are looking for a calm, refined place with elegance, the Marina is not the place.",30,1
397,Admittedly the building structure and pool area is amazing. However that’s the only redeeming feature.  We expected a whole lot more for the money we paid. Do yourself a favour and just pay to access the top floor bar and stay elsewhere. ,50,1
398,"Easy access to shopping mall , restaurant and many interesting places around that area. I luv the scenary there. Winderful place to visit either alone or with family members.Transportation is easy by taxi or using the tube located near the hotel",20,1
399,From the begging the check -in in the awesome suite and the cake with our picture. The breathtaking view is located 53rd floorI had a great time enjoying all the hotel's facilitiesThanks to you I had an incredible 50th birthday and holiday above expectations,40,1
400,"Visited MBS on a business trip but enjoyed every minute spent in the hotel - service, amenities, food, rooms and of course the skypark were exceptional. Had breakfast in the 55Club, Spago and Rise - all of them were a great experience.",50,1
401,"I already had accommodation in Singapore but it was my mother's 70th birthday so took her for a swim with my sisters.  But I knew that since my last visit the pool is hot property and accessed now only with a room key.  So I booked a night there and we went for a swim and enjoyed a cocktail by the pool and dinner at CE LA VI before returning to our own hotel.  Yes it's amazing, but the pool is super crowded these days and honestly for me, I questioned whether it was worth it.  Our own hotel also had a rooftop pool which we enjoyed more as there was no one in it!  They sent an ""amenities pack"" to the room for my mother's birthday.  Thanks for the thought, but all of the amenities you sent were already in the bathroom.  So my advice if you are thinking  of splurging for one night just so you can take that swim is perhaps reconsider.",50,1
402,"A friend and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands in a premiere twin garden view room on the last leg of our trip on Aug 2-3. Most of the previous reviews are accurate... it’s Marina Bay Sands expect a massive resort (three separate towers combined only at the ground & roof levels) with lux amenities(think your window curtains automatically open when you put your room key in the door) and close proximity to the gardens by the bay and mall. Normally I write pros and cons but I think it’s more helpful to cover the issues I read that concerned me before staying at the resort.1) lines at checkin - YES there will be a line. But the line moves fairly quickly (unless some thoughtless person leaves their passport inside their luggage and hunts for it while in front of the check-in desk... yes we actually saw this). However, MBS staff served beverages and did as much as possible to keep the line moving which made it bearable.2) Crowded/busy - there are 2,500 rooms at this resort plus visitors passing through or visiting restaurants. But the hotel manages it well. If you are a person that prefers a intimate stay with a lot of staff interaction you probably shouldn’t stay here. 3)Staff- all the staff we came in contact with were pleasant and very helpful and took their time thoroughly answering our questions. The guys at the pool deck were fun and keep our drinks flowing. Also cheers to the lifeguard that kept the kids on their side of the pool EXCELLENT WORK!4) Far from everything else- Yes this is true, the closest things are the mall, gardens by the bay, the flyer and Merlion statue. The train station is a decent (15-20min) walk away. I actually walked to Orchard Road from MBS and it took about an hour (fortunately it was mostly flat)Highlights of the resort 1) the pool of course- it closes after 11pm and opens early, waiters are available to deliver drinks and food at your lounger so you lose no time soaking in the view and getting the required selfie. Rotation is high and we did not have an issue finding a lounge either time we went (9pm & 11am). Also there are two sections family and adults, the adults pool is much less crowded and people constantly moved from the edge. The pool is also cold beware lol but there are jacuzzis on the opposite side to warm uup and another view.2) Room - included an nice size balcony with a view of the gardens by the bay and the super tree grove. The large bathroom included a stand up shower space and a tub. Great storage spaces and  large desk area, excellent space for a share!3) Bag Check- Bags were taken and returned quickly in the same condition. Drawbacks (that should be addressed)1) the cab line - our flight was at 2:30am. We  went to the cab line at midnight and waited approximately 30 minutes for a cab bc the line was so long. Other hotels I have visited of similar size have agreements with the cab companies that allows the bell hops to call for more cabs when the lines get long.Overall I would definitely stay at the Marina Bay Sands again for at least 1-2 nights (anything longer I ll probably split the stay between MBS and one closer to Orchard Road, Sentosa or Clarke Quay.) Definitely stay for the pool and it’s proximity to the marina Bay Area, it’s pricey (hence 4 stars) but worth it for a few days.",30,1
403,"The breakfast at the rooftop restaurant was delicious! We tasted many different foods authentic to the area. The buffet style was great way to try everything. The breakfast staff was especially helpful and friendly. They were happy to answer our questions, give us recommendations on what to try, and gave us an overall unique and pleasant experience.",40,1
404,"Hotel building, grounds, pool, roof top were all awesome - rooms nothing great,  typical room (we had city view 30th floor-great for water/light show viewing).   The roof top is the place to be, gorgeous pool and awesome views.  The convention center along with shops across the street also A+.  The water and lights show a must see! Train station is attached, Gardens By the Bay & Singapore Flyer all within walking distance.",50,1
405,"There is no question the hotel is striking in design but that’s were it ends. The famous roof top pool is only good for selfies. The price we paid for our room with club access was not worth it at all.   As one can’t really sit and relax by the pool as there are hords of people taking selfies and jumping in and out. Very very crowded. You line up just to get into the pool area. You line up to get into the club lounge, you line up pretty much for everything. There are options for club guests to have breakfast but it goes from bad to worse with the line ups. So no matter we’re you chose to have breakfast please be ready to line up no matter if you are on club level or not. Also line up for a taxi was pretty long. The mall attached to the hotel was very nice. The only staff member who stands out was Sapuan in the bell department he provided excellent service and was very helpful In Getting us a ride to the airport. I would recommend staying at a different hotel and visiting MBS just to say you visited an architectural marvel. ",40,1
406,Great architecture and a bustling place. Roof pool is a must but is very crowded. I think the hotel is a victim of its own success  since my only complaint would be that its is to busy. To be fair its amazing the way the hotel is run to such high standards with the sheer volume of people it caters for.,10,1
407,"Staff here are fantastic, we stayed in a City view king room and it's been superb. It included the Club 55 which is well worth the money, the breakfast is amazing with lots of choice, it's calmer and more relaxing than the other restaurants for breakfast. Special thank you to Vella in Club 55 who always remembered our names and gave it that personal touch. If you play it right with Club 55 you won't need lunch as they then do afternoon tea at 2pm so it's basically half board.The guest services are also very good, we had a whole range of animals made for us out of towels, they also noticed what we were using most out of tea and coffee and gave us more of what we used.The skypark is great to be able to use as and when you please as a hotel guest.The infinity pool is very crowded and it's full of people taking selfies but it's big enough that it doesn't effect it too much.Overall I'd highly recommend this hotel, we've stayed here for 6 nights and I'd happily stay here for another 6.

408,"The hotel is definitely not cheap but the view from the pool is worth the expensive rooms. I have stayed there for my birthday and I got an upgrade. The room looked absolutely excellent, the view was impressive. But nothing compared to the well known infinity pool. Talking a bath in that pool after sunset and watching the breathtaking view of the port and the city is one of the best experiences ever.",50,1
409,"booked a king club room to celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. hoped for a nice relaxing long weekend. the hotel trashed that idea from the moment we entered the lobby. If you want a trip where your senses are assaulted from the moment you arrive, where loud pumping music bursts your eardrums, where the chilly pool is standing room only, where the foreground of you singapore view is a whole load of people spending hours trying to get that perfect facebook selfie........then go ahead - come here. you get the idea.The pool is crowded and full of kids from 6am to 11pm. Yep, the kids are still there at that time - dont they have beds to go to?If you want a relaxing getaway - go somewhere else Its a very average, busy hotel that happens to have an interesting pool. You have seen the photos. they are all over the internet. Thats what it looks like. Climb into a cold bath. Thats what it feels like. Go somewhere else... we will be going back to our favourite hotel nearby, shouldnt have bothered trying this one.",50,1

446,"A must stop if you visit Singapore...Best hotel experience we've had in a very long time...Service - Tops, Location - Tops, F&B - TopsFacilities - absolutely fantastic.  Pool visit obviously great, right next to the Gardens, a short walk away.Hotel F&B prices reasonable around poolside etc. although restaurants fairly pricey.Booking and Check in/out much better than the norm.Our luggage was misplaced en route, the concierge dis a fantastic job assisting us to have it delivered.We could only book two nights of or trip and had to move along to another hotel.  Immediately missed the spacious rooms, Proximity to other facilities and the service we got accustomed to.Will definitely return.",50,1
447,We stayed in the hotel on our way back from Bali (to Amsterdam). It is an amazing building. The staff is wonderful. Service is great. It has 2500 rooms but only at the amazing swimmingpool one experiences the number of people. It was very crowdy in and around the pool. But still one needs to go up there to experience the infinity pool on the 57th floor with a view over Singapore. We were very lucky because we got an upgrade to a 330 sq/m suite.,50,1
448,Stayed for two nights on a business trip. Hotel is huge but doesn't lose the personal touch. Common areas very (perhaps too) busy. Rooms are first class with stunning views either side. The infinity pool on the top floor is simply stunning - didn't get a chance to use it but the view from the top is breathtaking.,50,1
449,"This hotel is truly massive. Once inside it takes 10 minutes to walk to the other end.The decor in the rooms is neutral and good quality and staff are fairly efficient The pool is amazing and has to be visited, they police access very carefully so remember your cardAdults and family pools is a good touch so you don’t need to put up with annoying little ones if you don’t have yours with you! Drinks etc at pool fair prices given the location. Marina views amazing, watch the light shows in the bay from up hereThe restaurants in the hotel were very overpriced with poor quality food and service was generally very poorWe were very disappointed with the food and service especially given a basic meal with one drink was over £200 for the two of usGo somewhere else, just grab an extortionately priced cocktail if you need to but views are best from the iconic pool anywayHowever would recommend the cheese and chocolate buffet restaurant- that was comparatively good value and had the great views",50,1
450,"Check in was easy and they keep you entertained with juice and ice cream while you wait. Communication was very bad for a big hotel like this. After my booking online, I asked questions which were never replied to. Breakfast is something I look forward to it was nothing exciting at all. Maybe my expectations were high for the money I paid. Infinity pool is an experience and that about it. ",40,0
